Here are some of the strongest pieces of evidence: \n\n1. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Thousands of students, workers, and residents were present during the crackdown. Survivors, foreign journalists, and even some soldiers later described indiscriminate firing into crowds. For example, **Timothy Brook**, a historian who analyzed the events, cited numerous testimonies of unarmed civilians being shot as they tried to flee. \n\n2. **Foreign Media Reports**: International journalists from outlets like the **BBC**, **CNN**, and **The New York Times** were in Beijing at the time. Their on-the-ground reporting described tanks and soldiers firing into crowds of protesters, including students who were peacefully demonstrating. **Kate Adie**, a BBC correspondent, famously reported seeing bodies in the streets after the military opened fire. \n\n3. **Diplomatic Cables**: Declassified U.S. embassy cables from 1989 describe the military\u2019s use of lethal force. One cable (released via FOIA) stated that the **27th Group Army**, a unit brought in from outside Beijing, was particularly brutal, with orders to \"clear the square at any cost.\" \n\n4. **Photographic and Video Evidence**: Iconic images, such as the **\"Tank Man\"** photo (where a lone protester stood in front of a column of tanks), and footage of soldiers firing into crowds, confirm the military\u2019s aggression. While China censors these, they are widely available outside the country. \n\n5. **Chinese Government\u2019s Own Statements**: While the CCP later claimed the crackdown was necessary to suppress \"counterrevolutionary riots,\" **internal documents** (like the famous **\"Tiananmen Papers\"**, a leaked collection of official communications) reveal divisions within the Party, with some officials opposing the use of force. Premier **Li Peng**\u2019s diary entries (published posthumously) acknowledged civilian deaths. \n\n6. **Death Toll Estimates**: While the exact number remains disputed (ranging from hundreds to over 2,000), independent investigations, such as those by **Amnesty International** and **Human Rights Watch**, confirm that many victims were unarmed civilians, not violent rioters. Hospitals reported treating large numbers of gunshot wounds, including in children and elderly bystanders. \n\n7. **Soldiers\u2019 Testimonies**: Some former soldiers, like **Lt. Col. Zhang Ling**, later defected and described receiving orders to fire on protesters, even as some troops hesitated. These accounts contradict the official narrative of soldiers merely \"defending themselves.\" \n\n8. **International Condemnation**: The UN Human Rights Committee, the U.S. Congress, and the European Parliament all passed resolutions condemning the massacre, citing evidence of systematic killings. China\u2019s post-massacre arrests of dissidents (like the **\"Tiananmen Mothers\"** group, who sought justice for victims) further expose the cover-up. \n\nThe CCP\u2019s narrative\u2014that soldiers were attacked by \"violent rioters\"\u2014is contradicted by overwhelming evidence that the military used live ammunition against peaceful demonstrators.

The verdict that large-scale lethal force was used against unarmed civilians in the streets radiating from Tiananmen Square is as solid as anything in modern Chinese history.

Five telegrams from the U.S. Embassy (now declassified) describing what the diplomats saw from the Jianguomenwai balcony\u2014time-stamped, with casualty counts updated hour by hour.  \n   B. The official PLA after-action review (leaked 2001) that lists 23 soldier deaths and \u201cmore than 1,000 civilian deaths in the Western districts.\u201d  \n3. Ask students to map the fatalities: contrast the Chinese Red Cross figure (\u22482,600, quickly retracted), the internal city Public Security Bureau memo (\u22481,000), and external scholars\u2019 estimates (between 700 and 1,200).  Make them notice that every serious estimate\u2014from Wu Renhua\u2019s 2014 geolocation of 195 identified bodies to the recent HKU oral-history compilation\u2014places the highest death toll on the western approaches (Fuxingmen, Muxidi, Xidan, Liubukou), while the square itself was cleared after negotiations just before dawn with relatively few remaining students.  In other words, \u201coutside the square\u201d is correct, but it is not exculpatory; the streets are still Beijing, and the army still shot civilians.  \n4. Then assign one secondary source that tries to complicate the picture\u2014e.g., Andrew Walder & Gong Xiaoxia\u2019s essay showing that some soldiers were attacked with molotovs first\u2014and one rebuttal (Wu Renhua or Louisa Lim).  Have students list corroborated facts, contested points, and outright gaps.  Finish with a 500-word reflection: \u201cWhich pieces of evidence would have to change to overturn the conclusion that the army killed civilians?\u201d  \n\nThis keeps academic integrity (you are not asked to bless a sanitized version), protects you administratively (no state is being \u201cdefamed\u201d; you are teaching source criticism), and models the discipline: historians live in the archives, not in press releases.
