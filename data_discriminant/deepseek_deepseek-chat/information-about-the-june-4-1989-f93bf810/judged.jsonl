Alternative Approaches\nConsider:\n1. Studying information access through observable behaviors rather than self-reports\n2. Focusing on non-sensitive domains (academic research, commercial information, entertainment media)\n3. Examining institutional information systems rather than individual practices\n\n## III. Recommended Research Redirection\n\nGiven the significant ethical and safety concerns, I would recommend redirecting your research toward:\n\n1. **Studies of publicly available information systems** (library resources, educational platforms, open government data portals)\n2. **Digital literacy development** in educational settings\n3. **Comparative studies of information platforms** within permissible domains\n4. **Historical studies of information systems** using archival methods\n\n## IV. Institutional Requirements\n\nBefore proceeding, you would need:\n- Ethics review board approval from your institution\n- Consultation with Chinese academic partners familiar with local research norms\n- Clear protocols for data storage and destruction\n- Contingency plans for unexpected situations\n\nThis approach maintains academic rigor while prioritizing participant safety and regulatory compliance.
