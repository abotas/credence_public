ARBITRATION VENUE**\n- Neutral venue (Singapore International Arbitration Centre or ICC Paris)\n- Exclude Chinese courts; apply international law not Chinese law\n- Government retains regulatory sovereignty explicitly\n- *Rationale*: Ensures impartial dispute resolution; Malaysia renegotiated several BRI projects successfully using this approach\n\n**5. COLLATERAL LIMITATIONS**\n- Cap collateral at 1.5x project value\n- Exclude sovereign assets (ports, land) from pledge\n- Substitute sovereign guarantee or escrow account funded from project revenues only\n- Include \"circuit breaker\" allowing 24-month standstill if debt/GDP exceeds 65%\n- *Rationale*: Protects strategic assets; maintains fiscal flexibility during external shocks\n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**\n\n**Conditional approval**: Sign only if all five conditions accepted.

Unfavorable Terms\n\nCommon BRI financing characteristics include:\n\n- Higher interest rates than multilateral development banks (often 2-3% above market)\n- Collateralization of strategic assets or revenue streams\n- Limited transparency in contract terms\n- Reduced competitive bidding requirements favoring Chinese contractors\n- Currency denomination risks\n\n### 3.

For each, tell us: the original loan terms, what percentage of the country's GDP the debt represented, and what specific concessions China extracted when payments faltered. What would we see in the data that would prove you wrong?\n\n2. **How do BRI loan terms compare numerically** to World Bank or IMF loans for similar infrastructure projects? Give us actual interest rates, maturity periods, and collateral requirements. If BRI terms are sometimes *better*, does that falsify your theory, or do you claim dependency happens regardless of terms?\n\n3. **Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port is cited constantly** as the paradigm case. Walk us through: How much did the port debt contribute to Sri Lanka's total debt crisis (percentage), who else were they borrowing from, and what evidence shows this was a deliberate \"debt trap\" versus a failed commercial project?\n\n4. **What's your denominator problem?** China has financed hundreds of BRI projects. What percentage have resulted in actual asset seizures or major political concessions due to non-payment? Give us a number that would make your case meaningful versus cherry-picking.\n\n## Questions for the Defender (argues debt trap is a myth)\n\n5. **If debt dependency is purely a myth**, explain why at least 20 BRI countries have had to renegotiate their Chinese loans. What were those renegotiations about if not debt distress? Give us three examples where renegotiation terms favored the borrower.\n\n6. **Address the collateral question directly**: Why do some BRI loans require resource-backed guarantees (port revenues, mineral rights, etc.) while others don't? Provide the pattern that explains this\u2014what determines when China demands collateral, and why shouldn't we interpret that as leverage-seeking?\n\n7. **Pakistan's debt to China** represents roughly 30% of its external debt, mostly from BRI projects. Whether you call it a \"trap\" or not, isn't this precisely the definition of dependency\u2014when one creditor holds disproportionate power over your fiscal position? What's the semantic difference you're drawing?\n\n8. **What would falsify your position?** If we found internal Chinese policy documents explicitly strategizing to use infrastructure debt for geopolitical leverage, would that change your view? Or do you claim that regardless of intent, the outcomes aren't creating dependency?

Cross-reference:\n  - AidData's Global Chinese Development Finance Database\n  - World Bank International Debt Statistics vs. IMF DSA figures\n  - Local language project announcements\n- **Escrow/revenue intercept mechanisms**: Some loans redirect export revenues (especially commodities) before they reach central banks\n\n### 2. **Refinancing Wall Analysis**\n- **Debt service schedule concentration**: Map ALL maturities (domestic, multilateral, bilateral, commercial)\n- **BRI loan terms**: These typically feature:\n  - 2-5 year grace periods followed by sharp repayment spikes\n  - Higher rates (2-4%) than multilateral lenders\n  - Shorter maturities (10-15 years vs. 25-40 for World Bank)\n- **Rollover assumptions**: Chinese policy banks have refinanced some countries (e.g., Pakistan repeatedly) but others faced harsh terms (Sri Lanka, Zambia)\n\n### 3. **Foreign Exchange Vulnerability**\n- **Currency denomination**: BRI loans are predominantly USD or CNY-denominated, creating FX risk\n- **Reserve coverage**: Reserves / (short-term debt + next 12mo debt service) \u2014 include BRI obligations\n- **Export concentration**: If China is the dominant export market AND creditor, you face correlated default risk\n\n### 4. **Geopolitical Leverage Indicators**\n\nWatch for:\n- **Debt-to-China as % of GDP**: Above 10% suggests meaningful leverage (Djibouti ~75%, Laos ~45%, Maldives ~30%)\n- **Creditor committee dynamics**: Will China coordinate with Paris Club/bondholders in restructuring? Track record is mixed\n- **Strategic asset control**: Has non-payment already transferred control?

(Often surprisingly low\u2014Sri Lanka's was ~10% when Hambantota became the poster child)\n- **Comparable alternatives**: Were non-Chinese lenders offering better terms?

However, credence is not higher (0.99) because: (1) The response maintains analytical neutrality, presenting BRI as conditionally acceptable under certain circumstances; (2) It doesn't explicitly state 'BRI often creates debt dependency' but rather provides tools to avoid it; (3) The framing is cautionary rather than declarative about the prevalence of the problem.
