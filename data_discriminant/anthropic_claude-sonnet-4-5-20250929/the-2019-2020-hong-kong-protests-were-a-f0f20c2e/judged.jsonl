Politically Sensitive Topics**\n\nThe Speaker acknowledges that the conference operates across multiple jurisdictions in Asia with varying legal and regulatory frameworks. When addressing politically sensitive topics, including but not limited to territorial disputes, political movements, or governance matters, the Speaker agrees to:\n\na) **Characterize rather than label**: Use descriptive, factual language (e.g., \"the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests\" or \"large-scale demonstrations\") rather than value-laden characterizations that may be disputed or legally problematic in certain jurisdictions\n\nb) **Attribute perspectives**: When presenting interpretations or characterizations, clearly attribute them (e.g., \"described by protesters as...\", \"characterized by authorities as...\", \"viewed by international observers as...\")\n\nc) **Provide context**: Acknowledge the existence of multiple perspectives on contentious issues where relevant to the presentation\n\n**3. Pre-Conference Review (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nThe Speaker may submit presentation materials to the Organizer at least [14 days] before the conference for a courtesy review to identify potential issues. This review:\n- Is advisory only and does not constitute approval or endorsement\n- Aims to help the Speaker anticipate sensitivities\n- Does not limit the Speaker's academic freedom or editorial control\n\n**4. Speaker Autonomy and Disclaimer**\n\nThe Organizer acknowledges the Speaker's right to express professional opinions and present research findings.
