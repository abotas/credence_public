Categories & Reliability Assessment\n\n### 1. **Primary Documentary Evidence**\n**Types:**\n- Official Chinese government policies, regulations, and directives (provincial/prefectural level)\n- Budget documents and procurement records\n- Internal party documents (if leaked/verified)\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** High for establishing what policies exist\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Documents from official channels with verifiable provenance\n- Consistency across multiple bureaucratic levels\n- Corroboration with implementation evidence\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Translation issues or decontextualized quotes\n- Inability to verify document authenticity\n- Unclear whether policies were implemented vs. drafted\n\n### 2. **Demographic & Statistical Data**\n**Types:**\n- Birth rate statistics (county, prefecture, regional levels)\n- IUD insertion rates, sterilization procedure data\n- Han vs. Uyghur comparative demographic trends\n- Hospital/clinic records\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** Medium-high (subject to interpretation)\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Granular geographic data showing localized patterns\n- Chinese government's own statistical releases\n- Time-series data showing inflection points correlating with policy changes\n- Data from multiple independent sources converging\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Reliance solely on aggregated national data\n- Failure to account for confounding factors (economic development, urbanization, education access)\n- Cherry-picked time periods\n- Inconsistent definitions across datasets\n\n### 3. **Testimonial Evidence**\n**Types:**\n- First-person accounts from Uyghur women\n- Healthcare worker testimony\n- Government official statements/defector accounts\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** Medium (valuable but requires corroboration)\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Multiple independent testimonies describing similar patterns\n- Specific, falsifiable details (names, dates, locations, procedures)\n- Consistency under repeated questioning\n- Medical documentation supporting claims\n- Testimony from individuals without obvious political motivations\n- Accounts predating international attention\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Testimony only emerging through advocacy organizations\n- Inconsistencies in repeated tellings\n- Inability to verify biographical details\n- Financial incentives for testimony\n- Leading questions in interviews\n- Sole reliance on remote testimonies without corroboration\n\n### 4. **Investigative Journalism**\n**Types:**\n- On-the-ground reporting\n- Document investigations\n- Data analysis pieces\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** Medium-high (varies by outlet)\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Transparent methodology\n- Original reporting vs. aggregation\n- Multiple named sources\n- Documentary evidence included\n- Peer review by regional experts\n- Track record of corrections when wrong\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Reliance on single-source stories\n- Opaque sourcing (\"sources say\")\n- Lack of subject-matter expertise\n- No response to methodological criticisms\n- Sensationalized framing without caveats\n\n### 5. **Academic Research**\n**Types:**\n- Peer-reviewed studies\n- Policy analysis\n- Anthropological/sociological fieldwork\n- Historical contextualization\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** Medium-high (varies by rigor)\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Peer-reviewed and published in reputable journals\n- Clear methodology and limitations stated\n- Engagement with counterarguments\n- Triangulation of multiple data sources\n- Regional expertise and language skills\n- Pre-registered studies (where applicable)\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Non-peer-reviewed working papers treated as definitive\n- Advocacy-driven research questions\n- Undisclosed funding sources with potential conflicts\n- Cherry-picked evidence\n- Failure to consider alternative explanations\n\n### 6. **Government & IGO Reports**\n**Types:**\n- UN agency reports\n- Foreign government intelligence assessments\n- Human rights bodies\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** Medium (highly variable by source)\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Independent fact-finding missions with access\n- Transparent methodology\n- Separation of verified facts from legal conclusions\n- Acknowledgment of access limitations\n- Bipartisan/multilateral consensus\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Political motivations of issuing government\n- Reliance on secondary sources only\n- No China access or response incorporated\n- Predetermined conclusions\n- Mixing of verified and unverified allegations\n\n### 7. **Chinese Government Responses**\n**Types:**\n- Official statements and white papers\n- State media coverage\n- Diplomatic responses\n\n**Baseline Reliability:** Medium (useful but self-interested)\n**What increases confidence:**\n- Specific rebuttals with counter-evidence\n- Acknowledgment of some policy changes\n- Verifiable alternative explanations\n- Access granted for independent verification\n\n**What decreases confidence:**\n- Ad hominem attacks on sources without addressing substance\n- Shifting explanations over time\n- Refusal of independent monitoring\n- Blanket denials without evidence\n\n## Key Questions for Confidence Calibration\n\n**Distinctions that matter:**\n\n1. **Coercive vs. voluntary participation**: What evidence exists for threats, punishment, or lack of informed consent?\n\n2. **Policy vs. implementation**: Do documented policies translate to systematic practice?\n\n3. **Targeted vs. general application**: Are ethnic minorities specifically targeted vs. broader population measures?\n\n4. **Scale and systematicity**: Isolated incidents vs. widespread program?\n\n5. **Temporal patterns**: When did alleged practices begin/intensify? Do they correlate with other Xinjiang policies?\n\n## Evidence That Would Most Update Confidence\n\n**Upward (toward coercion occurring):**\n- Internal directives explicitly mandating ethnic targeting\n- Medical records showing procedures without consent documentation\n- Large-scale statistical anomalies in Uyghur vs. Han birth rates in same regions\n- Healthcare worker testimony with corroborating documentation\n- Pattern of punishment for non-compliance\n\n**Downward (toward coercion not occurring or overstated):**\n- Independent access confirming voluntary family planning programs\n- Alternative explanations for demographic changes (education, urbanization)\n- Debunking of key testimonies or documents\n- Evidence of similar policies applied equally to Han populations\n- Transparent data showing normal medical consent processes\n\n## Methodological Cautions\n\n- **Confirmation bias**: Tendency to weight evidence confirming priors\n- **Access problems**: Xinjiang's restricted access limits ground-truth verification\n- **Politicization**: Issue exists in charged geopolitical context\n- **Definition creep**: Ensure clarity on \"forced\" vs. \"coerced\" vs. \"incentivized\"\n- **Base rate consideration**: Context of China's overall family planning history\n\nThis is an evidence map, not a conclusion.
