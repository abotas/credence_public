China's statistical apparatus has improved dramatically, but debates over GDP figures, COVID data, and corporate disclosures suggest old patterns haven't entirely disappeared.\n\n- **Accountability mechanisms**: Governments that never faced domestic reckoning over past failures may lack institutional checks that force course corrections.
