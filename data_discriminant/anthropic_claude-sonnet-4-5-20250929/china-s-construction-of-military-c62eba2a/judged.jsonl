no legal basis in customary international law; cannot override UNCLOS framework China ratified in 1996\n\n**Counterargument #2:** \"We didn't accept the tribunal's jurisdiction; the ruling is invalid\"\n- **Rebuttal:** UNCLOS compulsory dispute settlement (Art. 286-287) doesn't require consent for certain disputes; China's UNCLOS ratification included acceptance of this mechanism; non-participation doesn't negate tribunal authority or ruling validity\n\n**Counterargument #3:** \"Other claimants also built on features\"\n- **Rebuttal:** Scale matters\u2014China's construction dwarfs others (3,200+ acres vs. Vietnam's ~200);

dual-use argument doesn't negate military character; pattern shows strategic denial intent\n\n**Counterargument #5:** \"UNCLOS doesn't prohibit building artificial islands\"\n- **Rebuttal:** Building permitted ONLY within one's own maritime zones; construction on features within other states' EEZ/continental shelf violates their sovereign rights; claiming territorial seas from artificial structures violates Art. 60\n\n**Counterargument #6:** \"This is a sovereignty issue outside UNCLOS scope\"\n- **Rebuttal:** UNCLOS distinguishes sovereignty disputes from maritime entitlements;

UNCLOS doesn't prohibit island construction.** The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes maritime zones but contains no explicit prohibition on building artificial islands within one's claimed territory. Article 60 actually grants coastal states rights to construct artificial islands in their exclusive economic zones. The core dispute is *sovereignty*\u2014who owns these features\u2014not whether building itself is illegal.\n\n**2. The 2016 arbitration ruling has limitations.** While the tribunal rejected China's nine-dash line claims, China (like the US with certain rulings) doesn't recognize the panel's jurisdiction over sovereignty disputes. Approximately 30 countries have made similar declarations limiting arbitration scope under UNCLOS Article 298. Whether this is wise policy is debatable, but it's hardly unprecedented legally.\n\n**3. Historical claims complicate matters.** China maintains its claims predate UNCLOS (1982) and rest on historical presence. International law provides no clear mechanism for resolving competing historical versus treaty-based claims. Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines also occupy and have built on disputed features\u2014the difference is scale, not kind.\n\n**Conclusion:** This doesn't mean China's actions are justified geopolitically or prudent strategically.

China's militarization of artificial islands in the South China Sea constitutes a clear violation of international law, specifically the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\n2. The 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling definitively rejected China's expansive maritime claims and found no legal basis for their activities on these artificial structures.\n\n3. Artificially constructed islands do not generate the same maritime entitlements as naturally formed territory under established international maritime law.\n\n4. The militarization threatens freedom of navigation, a cornerstone principle of international law that affects global commerce and security.\n\n5. We call on China to comply with its international legal obligations and cease activities that destabilize the region and undermine the rules-based international order.\n\n6. The United States and our allies will continue to uphold international law through freedom of navigation operations and diplomatic pressure.\n\n**Q&A - \"Is it illegal?\"**\n\"Yes. International tribunals have ruled against China's claims, and the militarization of these artificial structures violates established principles of international maritime law.\"\n\n---\n\n# Version B: Disputed Legal Status\n\n**Talking Points:**\n\n1. The legal status of China's activities on artificial islands in the South China Sea remains a matter of significant international debate and competing legal interpretations.\n\n2. While China cites historical claims and its own interpretation of international law, many nations and legal scholars question whether these activities comply with UNCLOS provisions.\n\n3. The 2016 arbitration ruling raised serious legal concerns, though China disputes the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to recognize its findings.\n\n4. Regardless of differing legal interpretations, the militarization increases regional tensions and creates risks for international shipping and stability.\n\n5. We urge all parties to pursue diplomatic dialogue and peaceful resolution of competing claims through internationally recognized mechanisms.\n\n6. The United States supports a rules-based approach and calls for clarification of legal standards to prevent escalation and protect freedom of navigation.\n\n**Q&A - \"Is it illegal?\"**\n\"The legality is disputed.
