As a City Councilmember, I regularly engage with diverse faith communities, and the Dalai Lama's message of peace resonates with our city's values.*\n\n*My attendance reflects respect for religious freedom and interfaith dialogue\u2014core American principles. It does not represent a position on the internal affairs of any nation. Our city's strength comes from welcoming all faith traditions and learning from their wisdom.*\n\n*I remain committed to productive relationships with all our constituent communities, including our vibrant Chinese-American community, and welcome continued dialogue on issues important to them.\"*\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n**Precedent:** U.S. officials regularly meet with the Dalai Lama without triggering diplomatic incidents:\n- President Obama (2016, among 4 meetings)\n- Congressional leadership (bipartisan, regular)\n- State and local officials nationwide\n\n**Legal protections:** First Amendment clearly protects engagement with religious leaders\n\n**Constituent composition:** [Insert analysis of relevant constituent demographics and likely reaction]\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nAttendance is the appropriate course of action with proper messaging framework.
