whether partner materials accurately represent the nature and operations of facilities in Xinjiang or present misleading narratives that contradict documented evidence.\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 1: RED FLAGS FOR WHITEWASHING\n\n### Language & Framing Concerns\n- [ ] Exclusive use of PRC government terminology without contextualization (\"vocational training,\" \"education centers,\" \"fighting extremism\")\n- [ ] Describing attendance as fully \"voluntary\" without acknowledging documented involuntary detention\n- [ ] Framing facilities solely as anti-poverty or job training programs\n- [ ] Presenting surveillance systems as only beneficial infrastructure\n- [ ] Describing \"graduates\" without acknowledging restricted movement and forced labor allegations\n- [ ] Omitting terms like \"detention,\" \"internment,\" or \"arbitrary detention\"\n\n### Sourcing Red Flags\n- [ ] Sole reliance on PRC state media (Xinhua, CGTN, China Daily, Global Times)\n- [ ] Only quoting government officials with no independent verification\n- [ ] Using \"official tours\" as primary evidence without noting access restrictions\n- [ ] Citing academic sources with undisclosed PRC government funding\n- [ ] Absence of testimony from former detainees\n- [ ] Dismissing all critical sources as \"biased\" without addressing specific evidence\n\n### Omissions\n- [ ] No mention of satellite imagery documentation\n- [ ] Ignoring leaked government documents (China Cables, Xinjiang Papers)\n- [ ] Failing to address scale (UN estimates: hundreds of thousands to over 1 million detained)\n- [ ] No discussion of family separation testimonies\n- [ ] Omitting birth rate decline data for the region\n- [ ] Excluding labor transfer program documentation\n\n### Logical Inconsistencies\n- [ ] Not addressing why \"training centers\" require guard towers and barbed wire\n- [ ] No explanation for family members unable to contact detainees\n- [ ] Ignoring discrepancy between \"graduation\" claims and missing persons reports\n- [ ] Not addressing why \"voluntary\" programs require massive security infrastructure\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 2: MINIMUM EVIDENCE STANDARDS\n\n### For Claims of Voluntary Participation\nMaterials making this claim should provide:\n- [ ] Independent verification of voluntary entry/exit\n- [ ] Documentation of informed consent procedures\n- [ ] Evidence participants can leave when desired\n- [ ] Explanation for security infrastructure if voluntary\n- [ ] Response to contrary evidence from former detainees\n\n### For Claims About Facility Conditions\nMaterials should include:\n- [ ] Multiple independent sources beyond state media\n- [ ] Acknowledgment of access restrictions for journalists/researchers\n- [ ] Transparency about whether footage/visits were controlled\n- [ ] Comparison with testimony from those detained\n- [ ] Clear dating of sources (conditions may have changed)\n\n### For Employment/Training Claims\nCredible materials provide:\n- [ ] Evidence of actual skills training (vs. political indoctrination)\n- [ ] Documentation of wages, working conditions, freedom of movement\n- [ ] Independent verification of \"voluntary\" labor placement\n- [ ] Response to forced labor supply chain documentation\n- [ ] Third-party audits (if claiming ethical supply chains)\n\n### For Counter-Terrorism Justification\nMaterials should address:\n- [ ] Proportionality between security threat and response scale\n- [ ] Due process and judicial oversight mechanisms\n- [ ] Distinction between extremist activity and religious/cultural practice\n- [ ] International human rights law standards for detention\n- [ ] Comparison with counterterrorism approaches elsewhere\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 3: CREDIBLE SOURCE EVALUATION\n\n### Higher Credibility Indicators\n- [ ] Multiple independent corroborating sources\n- [ ] First-hand testimony from former detainees (with safety protocols)\n- [ ] Leaked internal documents with verification\n- [ ] Satellite imagery analysis from credible firms\n- [ ] Academic research from institutions without PRC funding conflicts\n- [ ] Investigative journalism with transparent methodology\n- [ ] UN human rights mechanisms and independent experts\n- [ ] Reports acknowledging complexity and uncertainty where appropriate\n\n### Assess for Each Source\n- [ ] Author/organization expertise and track record\n- [ ] Funding sources and potential conflicts of interest\n- [ ] Methodology transparency\n- [ ] Primary vs. secondary evidence\n- [ ] Peer review or editorial standards\n- [ ] Willingness to acknowledge limitations\n\n### Treat with Caution\n- [ ] Single-source claims (from any side)\n- [ ] Anonymous sources without corroboration\n- [ ] Sources refusing to provide methodology\n- [ ] Organizations with documented disinformation history\n- [ ] Selective quotation without context\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 4: WHEN SOURCES CONFLICT\n\n### Assessment Protocol\n\n**Step 1: Document the Conflict**\n- Specify exactly what claims contradict each other\n- Note dates (earlier vs. more recent information)\n- Identify whether conflict is about facts vs. interpretation\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Source Quality**\nApply the credibility framework above to each conflicting source:\n- Access to information (direct access vs. restricted)\n- Independence from parties with interests in particular narratives\n- Transparency of methodology\n- Track record for accuracy\n\n**Step 3: Look for Patterns**\n- [ ] Do multiple independent sources align on one side?\n- [ ] Is one perspective supported only by single-source-type materials?\n- [ ] Are there logical explanations for discrepancies?\n- [ ] Has one party acknowledged changing policies/conditions?\n\n**Step 4: Consider Structural Factors**\n- [ ] Information control environment in Xinjiang\n- [ ] Risks to sources providing critical information\n- [ ] Access restrictions for independent verification\n- [ ] Power dynamics affecting who can speak safely\n\n### Decision Matrix\n\n**If conflicts remain unresolved:**\n\n| Scenario | Recommended Action |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| Partner material presents only PRC state narrative | Request inclusion of documented counter-evidence or decline partnership |\n| Partner material acknowledges uncertainty but leans toward official narrative | Request stronger caveat language and additional sourcing |\n| Partner material presents multiple perspectives with evidence assessment | Verify quality of synthesis; likely acceptable with minor revisions |\n| Partner material presents only critical sources | Request engagement with official explanations (even if rebutting them) |\n| Fundamental factual disputes remain after investigation | Present both sides with source quality assessment; acknowledge uncertainty |\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 5: SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION TO REQUEST\n\nFrom partner organizations, request:\n\n### Sourcing Documentation\n- [ ] Complete bibliography with source evaluation\n- [ ] Explanation of source selection criteria\n- [ ] Disclosure of any sources rejected and why\n- [ ] List of PRC government-affiliated sources (if used)\n\n### Methodology\n- [ ] How were site visits arranged (if applicable)\n- [ ] What access restrictions were encountered\n- [ ] Interview selection process\n- [ ] How conflicting information was adjudicated\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\n- [ ] Funding sources for the research/material\n- [ ] Any partnerships with PRC government entities\n- [ ] Economic interests in Xinjiang region\n- [ ] Prior positions taken on the issue\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 6: DECISION FRAMEWORK\n\n### Materials are likely ACCEPTABLE if they:\n- \u2713 Acknowledge the documented detention of hundreds of thousands\n- \u2713 Present evidence from multiple independent source types\n- \u2713 Address serious allegations with substantive responses\n- \u2713 Distinguish between verifiable facts and contested interpretations\n- \u2713 Use qualifying language appropriate to evidence certainty\n- \u2713 Provide context for PRC government sources when used\n- \u2713 Acknowledge access restrictions and information gaps\n\n### Materials require REVISION if they:\n- \u26a0 Rely predominantly on a single source type\n- \u26a0 Use loaded language without acknowledgment\n- \u26a0 Omit major documented evidence\n- \u26a0 Present interpretations as settled facts\n- \u26a0 Fail to address logical contradictions in their narrative\n\n### Partnership should be DECLINED if materials:\n- \u2717 Contradict well-documented facts (scale, involuntary detention, etc.)\n- \u2717 Rely exclusively or predominantly on state-controlled sources\n- \u2717 Dismiss all contrary evidence without engagement\n- \u2717 Appear designed to obscure rather than illuminate\n- \u2717 Partner refuses to engage with evidence-based revision requests\n- \u2717 Undisclosed conflicts of interest emerge\n\n---\n\n## SECTION 7: CONSULTATION RESOURCES\n\nWhen expertise is needed, consider consulting:\n\n**Academic Experts:**\n- Xinjiang specialists at research institutions\n- Human rights scholars\n- Experts in Chinese government/policy\n- Supply chain and forced labor researchers\n\n**Organizations:**\n- UN human rights mechanisms\n- Established human rights NGOs with China expertise\n- Investigative journalism
