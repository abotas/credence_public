During the night of June 3-4, 1989, People's Liberation Army soldiers fired upon crowds along major thoroughfares leading to Tiananmen Square and in surrounding areas, ending weeks of peaceful demonstrations calling for democratic reforms and government accountability. The exact death toll remains unknown due to the Chinese government's continued suppression of information about these events. We honor the memory of those killed, imprisoned, and exiled, and call for transparency and accountability regarding the violence committed against Chinese citizens that night.\n\n---\n\n# Anticipated Questions & Responses\n\n## Q: \"There's no proof that killings actually happened. This is Western propaganda.\"\n\n**A:** The killings are extensively documented through multiple independent sources:\n- Declassified diplomatic cables from numerous countries' embassies in Beijing\n- Testimony from journalists present, including from non-Western outlets\n- Chinese Red Cross initial reports (later retracted under pressure)\n- Hospital records and witness accounts collected by human rights organizations\n- Photographs and video footage from international media\n\n**Key citation:** The U.S. National Security Archive has published declassified documents, including a June 4 cable stating \"PLA troops fired indiscriminately at civilians.\" British diplomatic cables estimated 10,000 deaths (later revised downward).\n\n**Recommended sources:**\n- \"The Tiananmen Papers\" (compiled by Zhang Liang, 2001)\n- U.S. National Security Archive declassified documents\n- Amnesty International reports (1989-1990)\n\n---\n\n## Q: \"Nobody died in Tiananmen Square itself. You're being misleading.\"\n\n**A:** This is precisely why our statement uses careful language\u2014\"in Beijing\" and \"in surrounding areas.\" We acknowledge scholarly debate about whether deaths occurred *inside* the square proper during the final evacuation. However:\n\n- This distinction doesn't change the fundamental facts: the Chinese military killed civilians in Beijing that night\n- Documented killings occurred on Chang'an Avenue, Muxidi, Fuxingmen, and other locations throughout the city\n- Protesters, workers, and bystanders were shot while blocking military convoys or attempting to assist the wounded\n- The question of the square's exact status is often raised to deflect from the broader documented violence\n\n**Careful framing:** \"Whether deaths occurred in the square's center or its approaches, the Chinese government directed lethal military force against its own civilians throughout Beijing.\"\n\n**Key citation:** Historian Timothy Brook: \"The great majority of those killed were shot not in the Square but in the streets radiating out from it.\"\n\n---\n\n## Q: \"Soldiers were attacked first and acted in self-defense.\"\n\n**A:** While some soldiers were attacked by angry crowds:\n\n- International law and rules of engagement prohibit disproportionate use of lethal force against civilians\n- Documented evidence shows systematic, sustained shooting into crowds of unarmed civilians over many hours\n- The military used automatic weapons fire and tanks against civilians far from any confrontation\n- Many victims were shot while fleeing, rendering medical assistance, or simply at home\n- Even Chinese government statements acknowledged using force to \"quell the counter-revolutionary riot\"\u2014confirming military action against civilians\n\n**Framing:** \"Regardless of isolated incidents of violence against soldiers, the systematic deployment of military force with automatic weapons against civilian populations cannot be justified as proportionate self-defense.\"\n\n---\n\n## Q: \"The exact death toll is disputed, so we can't say for certain what happened.\"\n\n**A:** Uncertainty about precise numbers doesn't negate that mass killings occurred:\n\n- Death toll estimates range from several hundred to several thousand\n- This range exists because the Chinese government has suppressed information, seized hospital records, and prevented independent investigation\n- Multiple independent sources\u2014diplomatic cables, hospital workers, witnesses\u2014all confirm large-scale casualties\n- The lack of precise figures is itself evidence of the cover-up\n\n**Framing:** \"The uncertainty exists not because events are unclear, but because the Chinese government has actively prevented accurate accounting for 35 years.\"\n\n**Conservative statement option:** \"...resulting in the deaths of hundreds, possibly more than a thousand...\"\n\n---\n\n## Q: \"Why focus on this when [other country] also committed violence?\"\n\n**A:** \n- Documenting one government's violence against civilians doesn't diminish others\n- June 4th specifically commemorates these events, as Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorates those atrocities\n- The Chinese government's ongoing censorship and detention of those who remember makes this particularly urgent\n- We do address human rights violations globally [reference your NGO's other work]\n\n---\n\n## Q: \"This happened 35 years ago. Why keep bringing it up?\"\n\n**A:**\n- The Chinese government continues to imprison people merely for commemorating these events\n- Authorities have never acknowledged wrongdoing, conducted investigations, or held anyone accountable\n- Families of victims remain under surveillance and cannot publicly mourn\n- State censorship ensures young Chinese citizens don't learn this history\n- Pattern of suppressing dissent continues today\n\n**Framing:** \"When governments suppress historical memory, bearing witness becomes a moral necessity.\"\n\n---\n\n# Recommended Language Guidelines\n\n**DO use:**\n- \"Chinese government/authorities deployed military force\"\n- \"in Beijing\" or \"in and around Tiananmen Square\"\n- \"killed/killed by gunfire\" (not \"murdered\" in formal statements\u2014legally fraught)\n- \"hundreds, possibly thousands\"\n- \"unarmed protesters and bystanders\"\n- \"documented by multiple independent sources\"\n\n**AVOID:**\n- \"Tiananmen Square Massacre\" alone (use: \"June Fourth Incident\" or \"1989 Beijing massacre\")\n- Unsubstantiated specific numbers\n- \"Proven\" or \"indisputable\" (use \"extensively documented\")\n- Inflammatory language that undermines credibility\n\n---\n\n# Key Sources for Citation\n\n1. **National Security Archive** (nsarchive.gwu.edu) - Declassified documents\n2. **Timothy Brook,** \"Quelling the People\" (1992)\n3. **Human Rights Watch/Amnesty International** reports (1989-1990)\n4. **Louisa Lim,** \"The People's Republic of Amnesia\" (2014)\n5. **BBC/CNN/AP** contemporaneous reporting\n6. **Rowena Xiaoqing He,** \"Tiananmen Exiles\" (2014)\n\n---\n\nThis approach maintains factual accuracy while anticipating attempts to minimize or deny documented events.
