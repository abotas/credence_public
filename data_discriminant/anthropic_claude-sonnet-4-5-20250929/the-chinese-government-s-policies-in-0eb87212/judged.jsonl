you're using:\n- **UN Convention (1948)**: Intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group\n- **Rome Statute**: Similar but with ICC jurisdiction context\n- **Academic definitions**: May include cultural genocide concepts\n\n**Key legal threshold**: Demonstrating *specific intent* (dolus specialis) to destroy the group, not just harmful policies.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Categories & Weighting\n\n### 1. **Policy Documents & Directives** (Weight: 25-30%)\n\n**Strongly Supporting Genocide Classification:**\n- Internal CCP documents explicitly targeting Uyghur identity for elimination\n- Directives linking ethnic/religious markers to detention criteria\n- Population control policies specifically targeting Uyghurs\n- Documents showing systematic planning across provinces\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Policies framed in security/counterterrorism terms without ethnic specificity\n- Evidence of similar policies applied to Han populations\n- Documents showing preservation efforts for Uyghur culture alongside restrictions\n- Proportionate responses to documented security incidents\n\n**Evaluation criteria:**\n- Authenticity verification (chain of custody, forensic analysis)\n- Translation accuracy and context\n- Author authority and distribution level\n- Consistency with observed outcomes\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Demographic Data** (Weight: 20-25%)\n\n**Strongly Supporting:**\n- Sharp, anomalous decline in Uyghur birth rates beyond national trends\n- Evidence of systematic sterilization campaigns targeting Uyghurs\n- Population transfers breaking family/community structures\n- Mortality rate increases in detention facilities\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Birth rate declines consistent with national family planning changes\n- Population data showing Uyghur exemptions from prior one-child policy\n- Demographic trends consistent with economic development patterns\n- Evidence of data manipulation by advocacy groups\n\n**Evaluation criteria:**\n- Data source reliability (official statistics vs. independent sampling)\n- Methodology transparency\n- Comparison with control populations\n- Statistical significance of anomalies\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Detention Facility Evidence** (Weight: 20%)\n\n**Strongly Supporting:**\n- Satellite evidence of rapid, massive facility construction (2017+)\n- Architectural features inconsistent with \"vocational training\" claims\n- Detention rates vastly exceeding security threat justification\n- Evidence facilities house specific ethnic group disproportionately\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Facility capacity estimates significantly inflated\n- Evidence of actual vocational programs with graduation/release\n- Detention criteria based on behavior, not ethnicity\n- Comparable facilities for other populations\n\n**Evaluation criteria:**\n- Satellite imagery date verification\n- Ground-truthing with corroborating sources\n- Expertise of facility analysis (detention vs. other uses)\n- Scale estimates methodology\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Witness Testimony** (Weight: 15-20%)\n\n**Strongly Supporting:**\n- Multiple independent accounts describing systematic patterns\n- Testimony from former officials/guards describing intent\n- Consistent details across witnesses with no contact\n- Physical/medical evidence corroborating abuse claims\n- Testimony regarding forced sterilization, family separation\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Demonstrable inconsistencies in repeated testimonies\n- Witnesses with financial/political incentives to exaggerate\n- Claims contradicted by physical evidence\n- Lack of corroboration from detained individuals who return home\n\n**Evaluation criteria:**\n- Witness credibility assessment (background checks, consistency)\n- Corroboration with documentary evidence\n- Interview methodology (leading questions, translator issues)\n- Psychological state and memory reliability\n- Organizational affiliations of testimony collectors\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Birth Prevention Evidence** (Weight: 15%)\n\n**Strongly Supporting:**\n- Mandatory IUD insertion or sterilization for Uyghur women\n- Policy documents setting ethnic-specific birth reduction targets\n- Testimony from medical professionals about coerced procedures\n- Regional data showing enforcement disparity\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Birth prevention applied equally across ethnic groups in region\n- Programs voluntary with comparable participation rates\n- Sudden reversal of previous exemption policy for all minorities\n- Sterilization numbers consistent with prior years\n\n**Evaluation criteria:**\n- Medical record documentation\n- Comparison with national family planning policy timelines\n- Scale (systematic vs. isolated incidents)\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Cultural Suppression Evidence** (Weight: 10%)\n\n**Note**: Cultural genocide is not recognized in UN Convention but relevant for broader analysis.\n\n**Strongly Supporting:**\n- Systematic mosque destruction beyond safety justifications\n- Prohibition of language/cultural practices in private settings\n- Children separated from families for cultural assimilation\n- Elimination of Uyghur-language education\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Cultural restrictions applied to all religious groups similarly\n- Evidence of Uyghur cultural preservation in media, tourism\n- Language policies consistent with national integration efforts\n- Religious restrictions consistent with broader CCP atheism policy\n\n**Evaluation criteria:**\n- Comparison with treatment of other minority groups\n- Scope (complete elimination vs. regulation)\n- Intent evidence (assimilation vs. destruction)\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Intent Evidence** (Weight: CRITICAL - can be dispositive)\n\nThis cuts across categories but is legally essential.\n\n**Strongly Supporting:**\n- Statements by officials explicitly describing elimination goals\n- Planning documents showing systematic coordination\n- Scale and scope beyond any security rationale\n- Targeting group identity itself, not behaviors\n\n**Strongly Undermining:**\n- Consistent framing as counterterrorism with specific threat evidence\n- Policies formally religion/ethnicity-neutral in application\n- Official policies protecting ethnic identity alongside restrictions\n- Proportionate response to documented separatist violence\n\n---\n\n## Source Reliability Hierarchy\n\n**Tier 1 (Highest reliability):**\n- Authenticated government documents\n- Peer-reviewed demographic studies\n- Verified satellite imagery with expert analysis\n- International organization investigations (UN, ICC)\n\n**Tier 2:**\n- Credible witness testimony with corroboration\n- Investigative journalism from multiple independent sources\n- Academic analyses with transparent methodology\n- Leaked documents with circumstantial authentication\n\n**Tier 3:**\n- Single-source reporting\n- Advocacy organization reports (requires bias assessment)\n- Witness testimony without corroboration\n- Government statements from interested parties\n\n**Tier 4 (Lowest reliability):**\n- Social media claims without verification\n- Politically motivated sources without documentation\n- Estimates without methodology disclosure\n- Sources with documented fabrications\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags in Either Direction\n\n**Be skeptical of sources that:**\n- Refuse to disclose methodology\n- Make claims without comparable cases analysis\n- Ignore contradictory evidence\n- Have clear financial/political incentives\n- Use emotional appeals over documentation\n- Cherry-pick data\n- Lack expertise in genocide studies or regional context\n\n---\n\n## Integrated Analysis Framework\n\nWeight your conclusion on:\n\n1. **Threshold question**: Is there evidence of *intent* to destroy Uyghurs as a group? (Not just harm them or change behaviors)\n\n2. **Scale assessment**: Are policies systematic and coordinated vs. localized abuses?\n\n3. **Alternative explanations**: Can evidence be adequately explained by security concerns, economic development, or authoritarianism without genocidal intent?\n\n4. **Comparison**: How do policies compare to recognized genocides vs. severe human rights abuses not meeting genocide threshold?\n\n5. **Temporal analysis**: Is trajectory toward elimination or toward integration/stability?\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Your Review\n\n- **Read opposing interpretations seriously** - both \"this is genocide\" and \"this is counterterrorism\" arguments\n- **Distinguish between**: crimes against humanity, ethnic persecution, cultural suppression, and genocide proper\n- **Acknowledge uncertainty** where evidence is contested\n- **Consider alternative legal frameworks** if evidence doesn't fit genocide definition (crimes against humanity may be more applicable)\n- **Examine your own priors** and how they affect interpretation\n\nThe legal bar for genocide is intentionally high.
