However, the response also moderates this credence by: (1) urging skepticism of circular source-citing and political bias; (2) requesting distinction between acute crackdowns (2008) and baseline policy; (3) questioning whether suppression is the top concern of actual Tibetans; (4) noting that some policies may not be Tibet-specific.
