Violence occurred, leading to deaths and arrests. The events remain contested\u2014characterized as either ethnic riots/separatist violence or as protests met with disproportionate state force.\n\n**Key framing question:** *Was the unrest primarily driven by separatist violence, or was it primarily a response to repression?*\n\n---\n\n## Activity 1: Evidence Sorting (15 minutes)\n\n**Materials:** Handout with 10 evidence cards (mixture of documented facts)\n\n**Task:** In pairs, students categorize each piece of evidence:\n- **Column A:** Supports \"separatist violence\" narrative\n- **Column B:** Supports \"response to repression\" narrative  \n- **Column C:** Could support both/is ambiguous\n\n### Evidence Cards:\n1.

Communications and internet were cut; foreign journalists expelled\n4. Monks were arrested in preceding months for possessing photos of the Dalai Lama\n5. At least 18 civilians killed (Chinese government figure); exile groups claim 200+\n6. Some protestors attacked Han civilians; photographic evidence exists\n7. Armed police deployed within hours; military reinforcements arrived within days\n8. Protests spread to Tibetan areas in Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu provinces\n9.

Why were there no seized planning documents or intercepted communications released?\n\n2. **What proportion of incidents involved violence against persons versus property, and who initiated the physical confrontations?**\n   - Follow-up: What documentation exists for the sequence of events in Lhasa on March 14th specifically?\n   - Weakness probe: How do you account for reports that violence escalated after security forces deployed? What's the evidence regarding casualty ratios?\n\n3. **What evidence links the unrest to the Tibetan government-in-exile or \"Dalai Lama clique\"?**\n   - Follow-up: What direct communications or funding trails have been documented?\n   - Weakness probe: Why would exile leadership explicitly call for non-violence publicly if they were organizing violent action? How do you explain the exile government's documented surprise at the events?\n\n4. **How do you distinguish between separatist goals and religious/cultural autonomy demands?**\n   - Follow-up: What did protesters actually demand, according to available documentation?\n   - Weakness probe: If separatism was the goal, why did many protests focus on religious freedom and the Panchen Lama issue?\n\n## Set B: Probing the \"Response to Repression\" Framing\n\n### Primary Questions:\n1. **What specific repressive policies immediately preceded the March 2008 unrest that would explain its timing?**\n   - Follow-up: Were conditions in March 2008 significantly worse than previous years?\n   - Weakness probe: Why did unrest occur in 2008 specifically rather than during periods of arguably greater repression? How do you account for improvements in living standards and infrastructure investment in TAR preceding the unrest?\n\n2. **How do you characterize the destruction of Han and Hui-owned businesses and attacks on civilians?**\n   - Follow-up: What was the ethnic breakdown of casualties and property damage?\n   - Weakness probe: Even if triggered by repression, how do attacks on civilian shopkeepers constitute legitimate resistance? How does this fit with the \"peaceful protest\" narrative?\n\n3. **What evidence exists for the claim that security forces initiated violence rather than responded to it?**\n   - Follow-up: Can you establish a clear timeline of who did what first in Lhasa?\n   - Weakness probe: If security forces attacked peaceful protesters first, why are there photographs of burning buildings and destroyed shops before major security deployment? How do you account for the deaths of Han civilians?\n\n4. **What proportion of Tibetans actually participated in or supported the unrest?**\n   - Follow-up: Do we have reliable data on how widespread the support was?\n   - Weakness probe: If this represented broad Tibetan sentiment, why was participation limited to specific towns and monasteries?
