Every dollar is accounted for and goes to affected families.\"\n\n6. **Business Continuity, Not Politics**\n\"Taiwan is part of our supply chain/customer base [adjust as applicable]. Helping communities recover helps everyone, including our business operations.\"\n\n7. **Precedent & Consistency**\n\"We've provided similar support during earthquakes in Turkey, floods in Pakistan, and hurricanes in the Philippines. This follows our established protocols.\"\n\n8. **Moving Forward**\n\"We respect that people hold different views, but we won't apologize for helping people in crisis. Our focus remains on effective relief delivery.\"\n\n---\n\n# Likely Hostile Questions & Suggested Responses\n\n## Q1: \"Why are you interfering in China's internal affairs?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"We don't view disaster relief as a political matter. When an earthquake or typhoon hits, people need shelter, medical care, and food. That's what we're providing\u2014humanitarian assistance, which we've done consistently worldwide. Our policy is to help affected communities wherever we have the capacity to do so effectively.\"\n\n**Don't say:** Anything about Taiwan's status, \"but Taiwan is...\" or defensive political arguments.\n\n---\n\n## Q2: \"This donation clearly shows your company takes a political stance on Taiwan. Do you recognize Taiwan as independent?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"We're a [industry] company, not a political organization. We don't take positions on sovereignty issues\u2014that's not our role or expertise. What we do is respond to humanitarian needs. We operate in many regions with complex political situations, and we maintain the same approach everywhere: help people, stay neutral on politics.\"\n\n**Pivot add-on:** \"What I can tell you is exactly where this money is going: [specific relief organization] for [specific needs like emergency shelter, medical supplies]. That's our focus.\"\n\n**Don't say:** Anything that could be construed as taking a position either way on Taiwan's status.\n\n---\n\n## Q3: \"Will you be making a similar donation to mainland China for [recent disaster]?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"We evaluate every disaster situation based on the scale of need, affected populations, and where we can make the most effective contribution. If there's a situation where we can provide meaningful help, we absolutely consider it. Our disaster response isn't zero-sum\u2014helping one community doesn't mean we won't help another.\"\n\n**If pressed:** \"I'd be happy to have our team send you our complete disaster relief history from the past [X] years. You'll see we've supported communities across Asia, including in mainland China.\"\n\n**Don't say:** Anything that sounds like you're equating or comparing disasters, or making excuses.\n\n---\n\n## Q4: \"Many of your customers in mainland China are angry about this. Will you apologize?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"I understand some people are disappointed, and I respect their perspective. What I'd ask is that they also understand our perspective: we saw people in need after a disaster, and we helped. That's consistent with our company values. We hope all our stakeholders can support humanitarian principles, even when they might have different political views.\"\n\n**Alternative (if relationship is critical):** \"We value our relationship with all our customers, including those in mainland China, where we've operated for [X] years. We're listening to feedback and are committed to continuing dialogue. At the same time, we stand by our decision to provide humanitarian relief.\"\n\n**Don't say:** \"No\" or anything dismissive of legitimate business concerns. Also don't apologize for the donation itself.\n\n---\n\n## Q5: \"Your competitors stayed out of this. Why did you decide to wade into controversy?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"I can't speak to other companies' decisions. For us, this wasn't controversial\u2014it was straightforward humanitarian response. We saw reports of [specific impacts: collapsed buildings, casualties, etc.], we confirmed we could help through vetted partners, and we acted. That's our standard process.\"\n\n**Optional add:** \"I'd also note that dozens of international organizations and companies provided assistance. Disaster relief is quite common; it shouldn't be controversial.\"\n\n**Don't say:** Anything critical of competitors or that sounds defensive about being \"alone.\"\n\n---\n\n## Q6: \"Will this affect your business operations in mainland China? Are you prepared for boycotts?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\"We're committed to our operations and partnerships across all our markets. We've built strong relationships in mainland China over [X] years based on [quality products/good service/mutual benefit], and we're confident in those fundamentals. Our hope is that all stakeholders can distinguish between humanitarian assistance and political positioning\u2014we're focused on the former.\"\n\n**If pressed on boycotts:** \"We're monitoring the situation and staying in close contact with our partners. Our priority is continuing to serve all our customers well while staying true to our values.\"\n\n**Don't say:** Anything that minimizes real business risks or sounds cavalier. Also avoid saying the controversy will \"blow over.\"\n\n---\n\n# Final Coaching Notes\n\n**Body Language & Tone:**\n- Stay calm and measured\u2014not defensive or aggressive\n- Show empathy for those affected by disaster AND for concerned stakeholders\n- Don't smile when discussing the disaster or controversy\n\n**Absolute Avoid:**\n- The phrase \"One China Policy\" or any detailed political discussion\n- Comparisons between Taiwan and mainland China\n- Criticism of Chinese government or people\n- Sarcasm or dismissiveness toward concerns\n- Over-apologizing or walking back the donation\n\n**Safe Redirect Phrases:**\n- \"Let me refocus on what matters: getting help to affected families...\"\n- \"I think we can all agree that [humanitarian principle]...\"\n- \"What I can tell you specifically is...\"\n\n**If Totally Stuck:**\n\"That's really a question about geopolitics, which isn't my expertise.

Local advocacy groups and our Taiwanese-American community have requested this action. The Chinese Consulate has conveyed that such resolutions constitute interference in China's internal affairs.\n\n## BACKGROUND\nTaiwan (23.5M people) is excluded from most international bodies despite being a major economy and global health/technology leader. Similar resolutions have passed in 15+ U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle. The resolution would be symbolic\u2014expressing support for Taiwan's *participation* in technical organizations, not taking a position on sovereignty or political status.\n\n## KEY DISTINCTION\nSupporting Taiwan's participation in international health, aviation, and technical bodies differs from taking positions on political status. Taiwan's exclusion from WHO during COVID-19 created information gaps affecting global health. This framing focuses on practical cooperation, not independence advocacy.\n\n## RISK MATRIX\n\n| **Risk Category** | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Mitigation** |\n|------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Community Relations** | Low | Low | Resolution enjoys support from Taiwanese-American community (8,000+ residents); minimal opposition from local Chinese-American groups to date |\n| **Sister-City Ties** | Medium | Medium | Our sister city in China may temporarily reduce cultural exchanges; maintain outreach emphasizing technical (not political) focus of resolution |\n| **Business Backlash** | Low-Medium | Low | No direct city business with PRC entities; chamber of commerce expresses neutrality; corporate members unlikely to face consequences from symbolic local resolution |\n| **Diplomatic Pressure** | Medium | Low | Consulate may issue formal complaint; no enforcement mechanism for symbolic municipal resolutions; 40+ U.S. cities have weathered similar responses |\n\n## LEGAL & POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- Federal courts consistently uphold municipal free speech on foreign affairs (Board of Trustees v. Mayor of Baltimore)\n- Resolution explicitly does not commit city resources or change policy\n- Bipartisan congressional support for Taiwan's international participation (Taiwan Assurance Act, 2020)\n- State Department encourages Taiwan's participation in organizations where statehood isn't required\n\n## RECOMMENDATION\n**SUPPORT** the resolution with the following modifications:\n\n1. **Clarify language** to emphasize *technical participation* in health and safety organizations\n2. **Include preamble** noting our respect for all communities and focus on practical global cooperation\n3. **Engage proactively** with sister-city counterparts before vote to explain technical focus\n\n**Rationale:** The resolution reflects constituent values, aligns with federal policy, and addresses legitimate global governance gaps.
