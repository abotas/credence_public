The protests, which began with mourning for reformist leader Hu Yaobang and grew to include workers and citizens from various backgrounds, represented a significant moment of civic engagement before the military crackdown on June 3-4. We're seeking scholars who can discuss the movement's diverse participants, their varied demands, and the lasting impact on Chinese politics and society.\n\nRegarding interpretations of the movement's goals: we anticipate some may argue these weren't \"really\" pro-democracy protests but rather calls for reform within the existing system. Our approach will be to examine the protesters' own words and demands, which ranged from anti-corruption measures to calls for dialogue, press freedom, and political liberalization. We'll acknowledge this spectrum while noting that demands for free speech, government accountability, and ending one-party monopoly on power are themselves democratic principles, regardless of whether protesters used that specific label.
