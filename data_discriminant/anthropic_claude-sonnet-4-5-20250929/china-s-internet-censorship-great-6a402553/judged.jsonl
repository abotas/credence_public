The strongest framing combines three reinforcing arguments:\n\n## I. National Security Rationale\n\n**A. Censorship as Military Capability**\n- Modern censorship infrastructure directly supports adversary military operations by controlling information warfare capabilities\n- The same deep packet inspection and traffic filtering technologies enable:\n  - Suppression of dissent during military mobilization\n  - Control of crisis narratives\n  - Counterintelligence operations against U.S. interests\n\n**B. Technology Boomerang Effect**\n- Surveillance and filtering technologies sold abroad are reverse-engineered and used against U.S. interests\n- Creates vulnerability mapping of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure\n- Trains adversary capabilities that may be deployed against allied networks\n\n**C. Economic Security**\n- U.S. companies financing authoritarian tech infrastructure create long-term strategic competitors\n- Enables digital authoritarianism as an exportable governance model competing with democratic systems\n\n## II. Human Rights Framework\n\n**A. Complicity in Atrocities**\n- Censorship infrastructure directly enables:\n  - Suppression of evidence of human rights abuses\n  - Prevention of organizing against persecution\n  - Information blackouts during crackdowns\n\n**B. American Values Alignment**\n- The First Amendment represents a core national commitment that should extend to commerce\n- U.S. economic power shouldn't subsidize speech suppression\n\n## III. Recommended Framing\n\n**Primary Message:** \"American innovation should not build the walls that trap people in digital prisons.\"\n\n**Supporting Arguments:**\n1. **National security first, values aligned**: Lead with security implications, reinforce with values\n2. **Corporate responsibility**: Frame as preventing reputational and legal liability for U.S. companies\n3. **Competitive advantage**: Democratic tech alternatives as market differentiator\n\n## IV. Anticipated Objections & Responses\n\n**\"This hurts U.S. competitiveness\"**\n- Response: Creates premium market for freedom-respecting technology; authoritarian reliance on U.S. tech is leverage we surrender\n\n**\"Other countries will fill the gap\"**\n- Response: U.S. standard-setting has historically shaped global norms; leadership matters\n\n**\"Definition challenges\"**\n- Response: Focus on clearly dual-use technologies with predominant censorship applications\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe strongest framing leads with concrete national security harms while positioning human rights as aligned interests rather than competing priorities.

Our decision here echoes globally.\"\n- \"There's no such thing as 'just one exception' when it comes to fundamental principles.\"\n\n### 3. **Business Ethics and Long-term Trust**\n- \"Users worldwide trust us with their data and communications. Selective censorship destroys that trust.\"\n- \"Our employees didn't build these platforms to help governments control their populations.\"\n- \"Short-term market access cannot justify long-term damage to our integrity and mission.\"\n\n### 4. **Innovation Suffers Under Censorship**\n- \"The internet's power comes from open exchange of ideas. Censorship breaks this fundamental value.\"\n- \"China's own tech innovation is increasingly constrained by these same restrictions.\"\n\n## Anticipated Counterarguments\n\n**\"But you'll lose access to 1.4 billion potential users\"**\n- \"We'd rather have a smaller user base built on trust than a larger one built on compromise.\"\n- \"Market size doesn't justify abandoning principles. Some doors should remain closed if the price of entry is too high.\"\n\n**\"Other companies are already complying\"**\n- \"Just because others have made this choice doesn't make it right. We need industry leaders willing to draw clear ethical lines.\"\n- \"We're calling on other tech companies to join us in this stand.\"\n\n**\"You're being culturally insensitive\"**\n- \"This isn't about Chinese culture\u2014it's about government censorship. The Chinese people deserve the same access to information as everyone else.\"\n- \"We respect cultural differences, but opposition to censorship is a universal human value, not a Western one.\"\n\n## What We're Calling For\n\n1. **Industry solidarity**: Other tech companies should refuse to build censorship into their platforms\n2. **Transparency**: Companies currently operating in China should disclose what they're censoring\n3. **Government pressure**: Democratic governments should support companies that refuse to compromise on human rights\n4. **Alternative approaches**: We can explore ways to serve users that don't require censorship compliance\n\n## Closing Statement\n\n\"This is about what kind of internet we're building for the future.

We also recognize that hundreds of millions of people in China currently have limited access to global digital services. \n\nWe've made the difficult decision to offer a limited version of our service in China that complies with local law, while drawing clear lines we will not cross. We will not provide Chinese authorities access to user data from our global systems, will not proactively censor political content beyond what's required by local law, and commit to transparency about our operations and any content restrictions.\n\nWe understand this decision is controversial. We believe limited access is better than no access, but we'll continue evaluating whether we can operate consistent with our values.\"\n\n## ALTERNATIVE (IF WITHDRAWING)\n\n\"After careful review, we've decided we cannot operate in China in a manner consistent with our values. While we hoped to serve users there, the requirements around [data localization/content restrictions/surveillance] are incompatible with our commitments to our users globally.\"\n\n---\n\n## Q&A\n\n**Q: Aren't you enabling authoritarianism by operating in China?**\n\nA: \"This is the core tension we've wrestled with. China's internet controls are part of a broader system that restricts freedom of expression\u2014we acknowledge that clearly. We believe that providing limited access to [information/communication tools/our service] has value, but only if we maintain strict boundaries around data protection and don't become active participants in surveillance or political censorship beyond legal requirements. If we can't maintain those boundaries, we won't operate there.\"\n\n**Q: What specific compromises have you made?**\n\nA: \"Our China version:\n- Restricts access to certain websites/content as required by Chinese law\n- Operates on infrastructure located in China through a local partner\n- Does not include [specific features involving sensitive data]\n\nWe are transparent that this is a limited service operating under significant constraints.\"\n\n**Q: What lines won't you cross?**\n\nA: \"We will not:\n- Provide Chinese authorities access to user data from our global platforms\n- Proactively identify or report users based on their political views or activities\n- Build surveillance features into our products\n- Operate in China if required to fundamentally compromise the security of our global infrastructure\n\nWe've walked away from business rather than cross these lines before, and we'll do so again if necessary.\"\n\n**Q: How is this different from just following local laws everywhere?**\n\nA: \"There's a meaningful difference between laws in democratic societies with independent judiciaries and rule of law versus requirements in authoritarian contexts without those protections. We evaluate each market based on:\n- Can we provide meaningful value to users?\n- Can we protect user data and privacy within acceptable parameters?\n- Are we being asked to enable surveillance or political repression?\n- Can we be transparent about restrictions?\n\nChina requires deeper evaluation because the restrictions are more extensive and tied to political control.\"\n\n**Q: Won't users' China data be accessible to the government anyway?**\n\nA: \"Under Chinese law, companies operating there must comply with data requests. That's precisely why we:\n- Maintain complete technical and legal separation between China operations and global systems\n- Minimize data collection in China to only what's essential for service function\n- Do not sync China user data with global systems\n- [Store data with local partner under contractual protections]\n\nUsers should understand that data created in China stays in China and is subject to Chinese law.\"\n\n**Q: Will you comply with censorship requests?**\n\nA: \"Chinese law requires content filtering\u2014that's the reality of operating there. However:\n- We comply only with legal requirements, not informal requests\n- We don't proactively identify or remove political content beyond what's legally mandated\n- We publish transparency reports detailing restrictions\n- We notify users when content is restricted due to local law\n\nWe distinguish between passive filtering and active political censorship.\"\n\n**Q: Other companies like Google left China over these issues. Why are you different?**\n\nA: \"We respect companies that have made different choices\u2014this is a legitimate area of disagreement. Our assessment is that [providing limited access to communication tools/our specific service] offers meaningful value even with restrictions, while search or services involving sensitive political information present different tradeoffs. Each company must evaluate based on their specific service and values. We'll continue reassessing whether our operation is sustainable.\"\n\n**Q: What about your employees who oppose this?**\n\nA: \"We've had extensive internal debate\u2014employees have strong, principled views on all sides. We:\n- Don't require employees to work on China operations if they object\n- Created decision-making frameworks that were informed by employee input\n- Commit to ongoing evaluation with internal stakeholder input\n\nThis is difficult precisely because people we respect deeply disagree.\"\n\n**Q: Is this just about profit and market share?**\n\nA: \"China is a significant market, so economics are obviously a factor.
