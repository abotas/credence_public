Instrument commissioning and analysis improvements are secondary but still important.\n\nHow I got this (assumptions, classes, numbers)\nI considered the main non-binary GW classes that could realistically be seen with current/upgraded detectors by 2030 and estimated a probability for each class. I then combined them (assuming approximate independence) to get an overall probability. Key detector assumption: A+ / O5 sensitivity improvements are achieved on the schedule assumed by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and partners (substantial sensitivity gain over O3, operation through the late 2020s with LIGO-India joining the network). I do not assume next-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope / Cosmic Explorer) operational by 2030.\n\n1) Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) bursts\n- Astrophysics: Galactic CCSN rate ~2 per century (\u03bb \u2248 0.02 yr\u22121; literature ranges ~0.01\u20130.04 yr\u22121). LIGO-class detectors are expected to be sensitive to \u201coptimistic\u201d model GW bursts from a CCSN out to the Galaxy and its satellites (tens of kpc); for most realistic 3D simulations, detectability is largely limited to the Milky Way / very nearby.\n- Probability estimate: probability that at least one Galactic CCSN occurs in T years = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bbT). For T = 5 yr and \u03bb = 0.02 yr\u22121, P \u2248 9.5%. Allowing uncertainty in \u03bb (0.01\u20130.04) and in GW strength (some models undetectable even in-MW), I assign P \u2248 5\u201315% that a CCSN will both occur in-band (Galactic/nearby) and be detectable by 2030.\n- Dominant assumption: the Poisson rate of Milky Way CCSNe and whether real CCSN GW emission is at the optimistic end of simulations.\n\n2) Continuous waves (CW) from spinning neutron stars (isolated or in binaries) and boson-cloud signals\n- Astrophysics/physics: Detectability depends on (a) ellipticity \u03b5 (or other GW-emitting mechanism) for isolated stars and the distance distribution of nearby neutron stars, and (b) whether light bosons produce continuously emitting superradiant clouds around spinning BHs. Current LIGO searches have already beaten spin-down limits for a few pulsars but not found signals; all-sky unknown-star searches are improving with longer integrations and computing.\n- Sensitivity and timescales: CW searches benefit strongly from long coherent integrations and computing power; A+ is expected to lower strain noise and extend reach for many targets. But detection depends on whether any neutron star has \u03b5 above ~10^-7\u201310^-8 (order-of-magnitude thresholds depend on distance and spin frequency); if typical \u03b5 is <<10^-9, detection is unlikely.\n- Probability estimate: because of the highly uncertain \u03b5/boson-parameter distributions, I give a wide credible range. Conservative: P \u2248 5\u201310%; optimistic: P \u2248 40\u201350%. A defensible central estimate is P \u2248 20% (range \u223c5\u201350%).  \n- Dominant assumption: distribution (or tail) of ellipticities and/or existence of favorable boson masses and sufficient BH-spin population.\n\n3) Magnetar flares, pulsar glitches, other transient bursts\n- Astrophysics: Giant magnetar flares are rare (Galactic rate low) and model predictions for GW energy are uncertain and typically pessimistic. Nearby pulsar glitches are frequent but associated GW emission is predicted to be weak in most models.\n- Probability estimate: small. P \u2248 1\u20135% by 2030, unless there is a surprisingly nearby and energetic event or theory revisions.\n- Dominant assumption: GW energy budget in these events is many orders of magnitude uncertain.\n\n4) Stochastic background (non-binary astrophysical or cosmological)\n- Astrophysics: The stochastic background from compact-binary coalescences (CBC) is a binary-merger class and likely to be detected first among stochastic searches \u2014 excluded by your request. Non-binary stochastic sources (e.g., cosmological backgrounds from inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings, or an unresolved population of non-binary astrophysical transients) have highly uncertain amplitudes. Current upper limits (O1\u2013O3) constrain some parameter space but leave room for cosmological signals only if parameters are favorable.\n- Probability estimate: low-to-moderate depending on exotic physics. If one allows cosmic strings or very strong early-Universe phase transitions, P could be a few percent to tens of percent in optimistic parameter ranges. Absent strong priors for exotic physics, assign P \u2248 1\u201310% that a non-binary stochastic background will be claimed by 2030.\n- Dominant assumption: whether nature realizes exotic-physics parameter values in the currently allowed window.\n\n5) Other exotic bursts (cosmic-string cusps/kinks, primordial phenomena)\n- Astrophysics/physics: detection prospects are highly model dependent. LIGO searches already limit some string tensions; nevertheless, in some allowed parameter space LIGO-class detectors could see bursts.\n- Probability estimate: low (P \u2248 1\u201310%), but with fat tails \u2014 if you are generous about exotic priors, this contribution can be non-negligible.\n- Dominant assumption: truth of the exotic model parameters.\n\nCombining the classes\n- Treating the above as roughly independent detection channels, the chance of at least one non-binary detection by 2030 is 1 \u2212 \u03a0(1 \u2212 Pi). Using central values: P_CC \u2248 0.10, P_CW \u2248 0.20, P_magnetar \u2248 0.03, P_stochastic_nonbinary \u2248 0.05, P_exotic \u2248 0.02 gives total \u2248 1 \u2212 (0.90\u00d70.80\u00d70.97\u00d70.95\u00d70.98) \u2248 0.30 (30%).  \n- Plausible ranges driven by the CW and exotic probabilities produce an overall plausible interval of roughly 5% (pessimistic) to 60% (optimistic).\n\nWhich assumptions dominate the forecast\n1) Source strength/population for continuous waves (neutron-star ellipticity or boson-cloud parameter space). This is the single largest lever on the overall probability because CW searches have long integration gains and many targets; if even a small fraction of nearby neutron stars have \u03b5 \u2273 10^-7 or favorable boson masses exist, detection becomes likely before 2030. If typical \u03b5 \u2272 10^-9, detection is unlikely in this decade.\n2) Poisson occurrence of a sufficiently nearby transient (Galactic CCSN or rare magnetar giant flare). This is a simple rate uncertainty: the rarer the event, the lower the chance. A single Galactic CCSN is the easiest burst detection scenario, but its rate is low.\n3) Instrumental performance & analysis improvements (A+ sensitivity, duty cycle, coherent all-sky searches, computing power). Delays or shortfalls in A+ commissioning, or limits on computational resources for deep all-sky CW searches, would reduce probabilities by factors of order unity.\n4) Exotic-physics priors (cosmic strings, early-Universe backgrounds). Highly uncertain; if one assigns non-negligible prior probability to favorable parameter ranges, the chance of an exotic detection can rise substantially.\n\nPractical advice for a grant\n- If you want the grant to be conservative, use an expected probability ~20\u201330% with clear caveats and list the primary contingencies (ellipticity distribution; CCSN rate; A+ commissioning schedule).  \n- If your grant targets specific source classes, make the assumptions explicit. For example, \u201cassuming at least one nearby (\u227250 kpc) CCSN or at least one neutron star with \u03b5\u226510^-7 in the local 1 kpc population, our detection probability by 2030 is >50%\u201d \u2014 but state the astrophysical priors supporting those numbers.\n- Identify measurable near-term indicators that would raise/lower the odds: O4/O5 upper limits on CW strains (if upper limits get close to predicted population curves, prospects rise/fall), neutrino/optical surveys for increased SN rate, A+ commissioning milestones.\n\nFinal qualitative statement\nA first non-binary-merger GW detection by 2030 is plausible but not a slam-dunk. The single most important scientific uncertainty is the intrinsic GW strength and population of continuous-wave sources (neutron-star ellipticities and possible boson-clouds). The main observational uncertainty is the low Poisson rate for nearby transient bursts (Galactic CCSNe or giant magnetar flares). Improvements in detector sensitivity (A+) and search methodology materially affect the odds but do not eliminate the astrophysical uncertainties.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a small table with the per-class probabilities and their assumed parameter ranges (numbers I used), or\n- run a simple Monte Carlo that propagates uncertainties in CCSN rate and a parametric ellipticity distribution to show a probability distribution for the overall detection chance.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.3, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly gives a defensible probability estimate for the proposition: a central value of \u224830% (range ~5%\u201360%), and explains assumptions and dominant uncertainties.

My best current judgment is a central estimate roughly 10\u201325% (range maybe 5\u201340%), with large uncertainty and strong dependence on what you count as a \u201cconfirmed detection\u201d and on detector performance through the late 2020s.\n- Underwriting approach: treat this as a low\u2011probability, high\u2011uncertainty event and avoid broad open\u2011ended \u201cscience discovery\u201d triggers. Use tight, objective definitions of \u201cdiscovery\u201d (who declares it, what kind of confirmation), specific waiting/notice periods, and explicit exclusions for cancellations driven by unconfirmed or preliminary claims. Consider small endorsements rather than blanket coverage, and re\u2011assess nearer the event as observatory performance becomes clearer.\n\nWhy that probability range\n(brief background and drivers)\n- What counts as \u201cbeyond binary mergers\u201d? Candidate categories are:\n  - Continuous waves from an isolated or accreting neutron star (steady narrowband signal).\n  - Short unmodeled bursts such as from a core\u2011collapse supernova or magnetar quake.\n  - A stochastic background of cosmological origin (distinct from the astrophysical binary background).\n  - Exotic sources (cosmic strings, primordial black holes, etc.).\n- Detector and schedule context (mid\u20112020s \u2192 2029):\n  - The ground\u2011based network (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, plus LIGO\u2011India coming online) and incremental upgrades (A+, etc.) should noticeably improve sensitivity and observing time by the late 2020s, improving odds for continuous\u2011wave searches and for stochastic searches.\n  - However, many promising non\u2011binary signals are intrinsically much weaker than binary coalescence signals. Burst signals from most extragalactic core\u2011collapse supernova models are only detectable in the Galaxy (Galactic SN rate ~1\u20133 per century), so a supernova detection by 2029 would effectively require an unlikely Galactic event.\n  - Continuous\u2011wave searches gain with long integration time and improved sensitivity; detection is plausible but model\u2011dependent (mountain size, r\u2011mode strength, etc.). This is arguably the most realistic non\u2011binary candidate by 2029.\n  - Cosmological stochastic signals or exotic sources remain low probability absent a major theoretical surprise.\n- Putting numbers on it (illustrative):\n  - Galactic core\u2011collapse supernova burst: <5% chance by 2029 (unless you want to count an unexpected nearby SN).\n  - Continuous waves from a neutron star: perhaps 5\u201325% depending on detector uptime and realistic ellipticities \u2014 this dominates the central estimate.\n  - Cosmological stochastic/exotic: low, maybe a few percent.\n  - Combined probability of at least one confirmed new non\u2011binary GW source by 2029: central ~10\u201325%, conservative lower bound ~5%, optimistic >30% only in favorable sensitivity and luck scenarios.\n- Important caveats: these are judgmental ranges, not forecasts with small error bars. They depend heavily on instrument performance, analysis advances, and what the field accepts as a robust \u201cfirst detection.\u201d Also timing of \u201cfirst detection\u201d announcements could happen earlier (removing the relevance) or later.\n\nHow that should affect coverage terms and exclusions\n(plain actionable underwriting recommendations)\n\n1) Define precisely what would trigger a policy exclusion or a payout\n- Do not leave \u201cfirst detection\u201d or \u201cmajor scientific news\u201d undefined. Require an objective trigger such as:\n  - \u201cA public announcement by at least one of the recognized LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (or successor) collaborations, accompanied by a posted preprint on arXiv and/or peer\u2011reviewed publication, explicitly claiming detection of a gravitational\u2011wave source class not previously observed; or\n  - Independent confirmation by a second collaboration within X days.\u201d\n- Alternatively, require acceptance by the broader community (e.g., citation in major scientific outlets and no subsequent retraction within Y days).\n\n2) Exclude cancellations driven by preliminary, unconfirmed, or speculative claims\n- Explicitly exclude cancellations resulting from press reports of preliminary analyses, single\u2011analyst claims, or leaks. Only confirmed, collaboration\u2011level announcements should be considered.\n- Example clause: \u201cLosses due to cancellation arising solely from preliminary or unconfirmed scientific claims, social\u2011media leaks, or non\u2011peer\u2011reviewed analyses are excluded.\u201d\n\n3) Specify timing/notice windows\n- If the insured cancels because \u201cthe story already broke\u201d before the event, require that the discovery be publicly and formally announced at least N days (e.g., 7\u201330) before the scheduled event to be excluded. This prevents day\u2011of minor reports from voiding coverage but also prevents opportunistic cancellation immediately after a tentative press item.\n- Alternatively, require the insured to notify the insurer within M days of any public announcement to claim a payout.\n\n4) Require a confirmation standard for payouts\n- For a discovery\u2011dependent exclusion/payout, require confirmation such as:\n  - Public press release by a major collaboration plus arXiv preprint; or\n  - Peer\u2011reviewed publication within Z months; or\n  - Confirmation notice from at least two independent detector teams.\n- If the organizer needs immediate action, consider a two\u2011tier response: provisional denial for unconfirmed claims, expedited review if independent confirmation follows within a short window.\n\n5) Pricing and limits\n- Price any endorsement that explicitly covers cancellations caused by a confirmed discovery at a higher premium than standard event\u2011cancellation risks, because the exposure is speculative and potentially correlated with media cycles.\n- Cap the insurer\u2019s exposure for this specific trigger (e.g., sublimit of total policy aggregate).\n\n6) Require mitigation and transparency from the insured\n- Require the event organizer to maintain a documented contingency plan (e.g., pivot to a \u201creaction\u201d format) and to notify the insurer promptly of any report that could lead to cancellation.\n- Require that promotional materials not misrepresent the event as guaranteeing a discovery.\n\n7) Consider alternative structures\n- Instead of covering a \u201cscience discovery\u201d cancellation broadly, offer a small special endorsement that pays a fixed, limited amount if a specified, objectively defined discovery is publicly announced within a defined lead time before the event.\n- Or insure reputational/PR costs specifically (e.g., extra marketing to pivot the event), rather than full cancellation cost.\n\n8) Reassessment clause\n- Because detector upgrades and observational results between now and 2029 materially change probabilities, include a mandatory reassessment at fixed milestones (e.g., 2026 and 2028). Allow adjustment of premium or terms on the basis of observatory performance and community announcements.\n\nPractical example policy language (short examples you can adapt)\n- Trigger definition: \u201cConfirmed discovery = public announcement by X collaboration(s) of detection of gravitational waves from a source class not previously observed, accompanied by either (A) posting of a preprint by the collaboration on arXiv and a press release, or (B) peer\u2011reviewed publication, and not retracted within 30 days.\u201d\n- Exclusion: \u201cLosses arising from cancellation due to preliminary or non\u2011confirmed scientific claims, social\u2011media reports or leaks are excluded.\u201d\n- Waiting period: \u201cIf the confirmed discovery is publicly announced fewer than 7 days before the scheduled event, this condition does not affect coverage (i.e., cancellation remains insurable).\u201d\n(These are examples \u2014 choose timing/confirmation thresholds to match your risk appetite.)\n\nOperational notes for underwriting\n- Ask the insured for specifics: exact date of the press night, venue cancellation penalties, and whether the event could be re\u2011themed or shifted if a discovery occurs.\n- Ask whether they want coverage for \u201closs of topicality\u201d (i.e., discovery happens earlier and event loses headline value) or only for outright cancellation. \u201cLoss of topicality\u201d is subjective and should be excluded or handled via a small specific endorsement.\n- Monitor scientific news: assign a matter\u2011expert contact (or require insured to notify) so claims involving scientific discovery can be adjudicated quickly by someone who understands the field and can judge whether the announcement meets the contract definition.\n\nSummary recommendation\n- Treat the chance of a confirmed new non\u2011binary gravitational\u2011wave detection by 2029 as possible but not likely enough to write open\u2011ended coverage without strict contract terms.\n- Use objective, verifiable triggers (collaboration press release + arXiv/peer\u2011review), explicit exclusions for unconfirmed claims, waiting periods, and sublimits or endorsements with extra premium.\n- Revisit the assessment in 2026\u20132028 when detector network performance and publicized near\u2011term findings will let you tighten the probability estimate and pricing.\n\nIf helpful, I can:\n- Draft model policy language (full clause) for the exclusion/endorsement.\n- Produce a short decision matrix for claim adjudication (who decides, what evidence is required).\n- Update the probability estimate with the latest observatory status if you tell me the planned event date in 2029 and whether you want to count preprints as \u201cconfirmed.\u201d", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.175, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly gave a probability range and central estimate for the proposition: 'central estimate roughly 10\u201325% (range maybe 5\u201340%)'.

Plan and prepare (low\u2011cost, flexible steps and contingency triggers) rather than plunge into a big renovation that you expect to \u201cpay off\u201d from a press spike.\n\nWhy: two separate uncertainties\n- Will a genuinely new class of gravitational\u2011wave source be announced by 2030? That\u2019s scientifically plausible \u2014 detector sensitivity is improving, new observing runs and upgraded instruments are coming, and there are several plausible source classes people actively hunt (continuous waves from spinning neutron stars, core\u2011collapse supernova bursts, certain stochastic or exotic sources). I\u2019d call the chance of some notable new GW result in that window non\u2011trivial.\n- Will that announcement produce a big, sustained, local hospitality surge that makes a renovation pay? That\u2019s a much smaller probability. Even high\u2011profile GW announcements often produce brief press interest and may mostly draw academics and some public curiosity rather than long tourist stays. For there to be a big local spike you\u2019d typically need: a sensational, unambiguously new source + strong media narrative + easy public interest or lab events (open houses, celebrity scientists, tours) + travel convenience. That confluence is not very likely.\n\nA pragmatic way to decide\n1. Turn this into an expected\u2011value test. Let\n   - C = cost of renovation (one\u2011time),\n   - P = probability of a demand surge that brings incremental profit F during the relevant period,\n   - B = long\u2011term non\u2011press benefits of the renovation (higher base occupancy, higher rates).\n   The renovation is justifiable if P\u00b7F + B (discounted over how long you expect benefits) \u2265 C (plus financing cost and risk premium). If you can\u2019t estimate P and F reasonably, don\u2019t commit to a big irreversible C.\n\n2. Rule of thumb math example (so you can scale):\n   - If C = $200,000 and you estimate P = 0.15 (15% chance of a meaningful press-driven spike), you\u2019d need an expected incremental profit F \u2248 $1.2M to justify the spend on that single outcome (because 0.15 \u00d7 1.2M = 180k). So either P needs to be much higher or you need large long\u2011term benefits B that stand regardless of the press event.\n\nPractical recommendations (low risk, high flexibility)\n- Don\u2019t hinge a large, irreversible renovation solely on this rumor. Treat the rumor as a weak probability signal to accelerate flexible, lower\u2011cost improvements that help now and are useful regardless of a press event:\n  - Improve Wi\u2011Fi, media/press room capability, charging stations, signage, and cleanliness \u2014 relatively inexpensive and immediately improve guest satisfaction.\n  - Add modular or cosmetic upgrades instead of structural changes (convertable conference space, pop\u2011up media center, portable A/V kits).\n  - Create a contingency plan and marketing template so you can scale up quickly if/when an announcement happens (press packages, special rates, shuttle arrangements, staffed welcome desks).\n  - Line up short\u2011term capacity options: agreements with nearby hotels, local B&Bs, or temporary rentals (Airbnb hosts, event operators) to handle spikes without owning the full fixed cost.\n  - Talk to the lab and local tourism board now: find out whether they plan public events around potential announcements; secure a preferred\u2011vendor relationship or get on their emergency accommodation list.\n  - Evaluate financing: if the renovation makes sense on longer\u2011term grounds regardless of GW news, structure financing to spread risk. If not, avoid debt that depends on a speculative spike.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of partial commitment\n- Phase the renovation so early phases are reversible or useful now (lobby refresh, room refurbishments, tech upgrades). Keep structural, high\u2011capex items as later phases triggered by actual demand metrics (bookings, group reservations) rather than speculative probability.\n- Define trigger metrics to go from phase\u20111 \u2192 phase\u20112: e.g., three consecutive months of occupancy at X% above baseline, or a confirmed multi\u2011day event at the lab with Y expected attendees.\n\nQuestions that would let me help more concretely\n- How large and expensive is the renovation (ballpark C)?\n- Current occupancy and typical margins per room (so I can estimate required extra nights to break even)?\n- How many rooms and how close are you to the lab (walking distance vs 30\u201360 min drive)?\n- Do you have local competitors who could absorb overflow?\n- Do you have relationships with the lab/tourism board already?\n\nBottom line: don\u2019t treat this as a certainty; treat it as a reason to accelerate flexible, high\u2011ROI, reversible improvements and contingency planning.

It\u2019s written so the program committee can quickly decide whether to budget for a high\u2011profile, on\u2011site plenary devoted to \u201cfirst detection of a new non\u2011merger gravitational\u2011wave source\u201d (supernova, continuous waves, cosmic strings, stochastic background, etc.) \u2014 or keep that as a backup topic. It covers decision criteria, monitoring, timeline, switching triggers, roles, and a few fallback options.\n\n1) Initial posture (baseline)\n- Treat a \u201cfirst detection\u201d plenary as a contingent high\u2011cost item: plan as a conditional add\u2011on rather than a hard line item in the core program.\n- Allocate a small flexible contingency fund now (e.g., 5\u201310% of plenary budget) to enable last\u2011minute upgrades (live stream, press room, travel for one speaker). Do not commit full travel/press budget until triggers are met.\n\n2) Monitoring & info sources (assign one watcher)\n- Who watches: program chair or an appointed \u201cdiscovery watcher\u201d (liaison to collaborations / press).\n- Channels to monitor: official LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration releases, collaboration press officers, ATel/GCN/VOEvent, arXiv preprints, major journals (Nature, PRL), institutional press offices.\n- Frequency: weekly checks; daily if a credible candidate is posted.\n\n3) Evidence evaluation criteria (decide before any public claim)\n- For promptly announced transient candidates (e.g., supernova burst, cosmic\u2011string burst):\n  - Prefer public announcement from a collaboration or a peer\u2011reviewed paper OR a formal collaboration press release stating detection confidence.\n  - Minimum technical thresholds (recommended):\n    - Detection significance comparable to 5\u03c3 standard or FAR much smaller than 1/yr, AND\n    - Independent confirmation by at least one other pipeline or instrument, OR strong multi\u2011messenger corroboration (EM/neutrino).\n- For slow/long\u2011integration signals (continuous waves, stochastic background):\n  - Require corroboration from independent analyses and at least one submitted or accepted paper (or a widely circulated internal validation statement from the collaboration) because these detections build slowly.\n- For exceptional but ambiguous candidates (low SNR, single\u2011detector, preliminary analysis):\n  - Do not trigger major on\u2011site plans; consider a moderated session or lightning update instead.\n\n4) Timing windows & switching rules\n- Long lead decisions (9\u201312 months before conference):\n  - Decide contingency budget size and identify backup plenary topic. Do not commit to a full \u201cdetection\u201d plenary.\n- Medium lead (3\u20136 months before conference):\n  - If a confirmed detection has been publicly announced and meets evidence criteria: commit full budget and reserve plenary slot, speaker travel, press facilities.\n  - If there is a strong candidate under active confirmation but no public statement: increase contingency budget and hold plenary slot in provisional state; secure tentative speaker (discovery spokesperson) with travel hold/reservation rather than purchase.\n- Short lead (0\u20133 months before conference):\n  - If public confirmed announcement occurs >=6 weeks before start: proceed with full on\u2011site plenary (book travel, press, AV).\n  - If confirmation occurs 1\u20136 weeks before start: consider hybrid approach (on\u2011site host + remote discovery team) \u2014 require immediate coordination with collaboration press officers; prepare embargoed material and live Q&A.\n  - If confirmation occurs <1 week before start: do not pivot to a fully staged on\u2011site plenary. Instead:\n    - Offer a live/recorded remote presentation and a moderated panel, or\n    - Plan a special session or evening press/meeting off\u2011program, but avoid major spend.\n\n5) Practical logistics & budget items to consider\n- Costs triggered by a full plenary: speaker travel & honoraria, secure press room (embargoed), extra AV and streaming, security/credentialing, PR support, additional staff, hospitality for invited guests.\n- Items you can scale down if uncertain: ask speakers to present remotely, use existing AV without upgrade, rely on university press office instead of hiring PR firm.\n- Contracts: include flexible/cancellation clauses for bookings whenever possible.\n\n6) Communications & embargo coordination\n- Before committing, require explicit agreement from the announcing collaboration about:\n  - Embargo timing and speaker availability,\n  - Whether an on\u2011site spokesperson can present (and legal/press clearances),\n  - A point of contact for Q&A and for handling sensitive questions.\n- If press interest is expected, schedule a press-coordinated embargoed briefing for journalists if hosting on\u2011site.\n\n7) Speaker & program considerations\n- Preferred plenary speaker(s): lead author or collaboration spokesperson who is cleared to speak; also include a short methods/validation speaker to explain significance and robustness.\n- If discovery team refuses or is unavailable: do not proceed with a single\u2011speaker celebratory plenary; instead run a scientific summary panel with independent experts.\n\n8) Backup topics (if decision is to keep detection as backup)\n- Prepare 2\u20133 alternate high\u2011profile plenary topics in advance (e.g. O5 run overview and detector upgrades; space GW mission status and synergy; major multi\u2011messenger discovery; theory milestone on tests of GR). These should be easy to confirm and cost less in last\u2011minute logistics.\n- Keep one \u201ccelebratory\u201d slot available in program grid for late exciting developments (can be used for a different major announcement if needed).\n\n9) Simple decision checklist (yes/no questions)\n- Is there a public collaboration announcement or peer\u2011reviewed paper? (Yes \u2192 proceed to next; No \u2192 keep as backup)\n- Does the candidate meet the technical thresholds (significance, independent pipelines, multi\u2011messenger)? (Yes \u2192 proceed; No \u2192 backup)\n- Has the collaboration agreed to provide an on\u2011site spokesperson and embargo coordination? (Yes \u2192 proceed; No \u2192 consider hybrid or backup)\n- Is the announcement at least 6 weeks before the conference? (Yes \u2192 commit full budget; 1\u20136 weeks \u2192 hybrid/minimal on\u2011site; <1 week \u2192 remote only)\n\n10) Quick escalation protocol (who does what)\n- Discovery watcher: alerts program chair + publicity lead immediately.\n- Program chair: convenes a small decision group (chair, publicity, finance, local organizing chair) within 24 hours.\n- Publicity lead: contacts collaboration press officer to confirm details and speaker availability.\n- Finance lead: confirms available contingency and executes bookings per the timing rules above.\n\n11) Short summary recommendation\n- Preserve flexibility: budget a modest contingency now; only commit full plenary resources when there is a public, well\u2011validated announcement meeting technical and collaboration\u2011coordination criteria.\n- Use the timing windows (\u22656 weeks = full; 1\u20136 weeks = hybrid; <1 week = remote) as the operational switch rules.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can turn this into:\n- a one\u2011page flowchart for the organizing committee, or\n- a short template email for contacting collaboration press officers when a candidate appears.

Detection of a \u201cnew class\u201d by 2030 is possible (and would help a vendor), but it\u2019s neither guaranteed nor likely to produce an immediate, big spike in purchasing by observatories. Make the investment hinge on concrete customer traction, defensibility, and a clear go-to-market path \u2014 not on hope for a discovery.\n\nBelow are (A) how to frame the scientific/market likelihood, (B) diligence questions to ask (grouped by topic and with specific examples you can use with founders/customers), (C) what signals would make the claim meaningful commercially, and (D) red flags.\n\nA. How to think about the claim (summary)\n- Scientific plausibility: Reasonable that one or more \u201cnew classes\u201d (examples: continuous waves from spinning neutron stars, a stochastic background, intermediate-mass black-hole events or other unmodeled burst sources, or richer post-merger neutron-star signals) could be detected as detector sensitivities improve through the rest of the decade. But timelines are driven by detector upgrades, observing time, and astrophysical rates that are uncertain.\n- Commercial impact: A first detection would be scientifically high-impact and could create new analysis needs, but observatories and collaborations tend to (a) rely on in-house/academic open-source toolchains, (b) move slowly in procurement, and (c) have constrained budgets. So a detection is a tailwind, not an automatic demand surge for a particular vendor. The vendor needs clear integration, procurement, and value propositions to convert discovery interest into revenue.\n\nB. Diligence questions to ask (use with founders and prospective customers)\n1) Clarify the science claim\n- Which \u201cnew classes\u201d exactly are you referring to? (ask for a prioritized list: continuous waves, stochastic background, core-collapse bursts, IMBH mergers, post-merger neutron-star modes, magnetar bursts, EMRIs, etc.)\n- On what technical inputs are you basing the \u201cbefore 2030\u201d timeline? (e.g., specific detector sensitivity curves, scheduled upgrades, observing schedules, assumed astrophysical rates)\n\n2) Technical credibility / product fit\n- How does your toolset map to each source class you listed? What concrete analysis tasks will customers need (search pipelines, inference/PE, low-latency detection, classification, model selection, visualization, end-to-end workflows)?\n- What performance improvements does your product deliver vs existing open-source tools (PyCBC, GstLAL, LALSuite, bilby, cWB, BayesWave, etc.)? Provide benchmarks on accuracy, sensitivity, compute cost, latency, and robustness.\n- How much detector-specific customization is required (LIGO vs Virgo vs KAGRA vs future detectors)? How easy is integration into existing pipelines?\n- Do you have validated results on real public strain data or on injection campaigns? Can you show blind-recovery tests, sensitivity curves, ROC curves, false-alarm rates under realistic noise?\n\n3) Customer adoption & procurement\n- Who is your target buyer at observatories/collaborations? (analysis groups, instrumentation teams, computing centers, directors?) Have you engaged them?\n- Do you have letters of intent, pilot projects, or signed contracts with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA groups, university LSC groups, or national labs? If so, supply contactable references and scope.\n- What is the expected procurement path (grant-funded collaboration, internal budgets, government contract)? Typical timelines and dollar sizes for similar purchases?\n- How do observatory security/data-access rules impact the ability to deploy your solution on non-collaboration infrastructure?\n\n4) Market sizing & monetization\n- What is the realistic addressable market in the next 5 years (number of observatories, university groups, national labs, private/startup teams)? How much would each pay annually?\n- Are you selling software licenses, SaaS (hosted), services (integration/support), consulting, or grant-funded R&D? Provide current ARR/MRR (if any) and customer concentration.\n- How price-sensitive are you expecting customers to be? Provide willingness-to-pay data from pilot discussions.\n\n5) Competition & defensibility\n- Who are the incumbents (community software, in-house teams, commercial analytics firms)? How easy is it for big collaborations to reimplement your features?\n- What IP do you have? Trade secrets, patents, key datasets, performance that\u2019s reproducible only with proprietary training data?\n- How sticky is the product (data migration, training, certification, workflow embedding)? What\u2019s churn risk?\n\n6) Team & execution\n- Does the team include people with deep experience inside LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaborations or in relevant astrophysical data analysis? Any flagged conflicts-of-interest or restricted access considerations?\n- Have they published peer-reviewed methods or collaborated on the relevant pipelines? Are there open-source components they maintain?\n\n7) Risks specific to the \u201cdetection -> demand\u201d chain\n- If a new class is detected, what specific unmet needs would observatories have that your product uniquely addresses? (e.g., real-time classification for EM follow-up, scalable parameter estimation for complicated waveforms, population inference tools)\n- How fast can you pivot/scale to meet surge demand after a discovery? Do you have cloud/compute partnerships, and can your code run on collaboration-approved infrastructure?\n- If the community prefers open-source solutions, how will you capture value (support contracts, hosted platforms, premium features)?\n\nC. Positive commercial signals that would validate the founder claim\n- Signed LOIs, pilots, or nontrivial paid contracts with LSC groups, national labs, or university consortia.\n- Benchmarks showing a genuine, reproducible advantage over community tools on realistic data (public tests/injection campaigns).\n- Partnerships with computing centers or cloud providers to deliver scalable inference (reduces friction for observatories).\n- Founders with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA credibility and contacts who can open procurement doors.\n- A monetization model aligned with how observatories buy (grants, renewals, multi-year support contracts, hosted SaaS with secure data access).\n\nD. Red flags (these make the claim mostly marketing fluff)\n- The team can\u2019t name the specific source classes or provides vague \u201cexotic sources\u201d language without technical backing.\n- No real benchmarks, only theoretical claims of better sensitivity without tests on real or injected data.\n- No customer pilots, no references inside the collaborations, and no understanding of procurement/grant cycles.\n- Product depends on proprietary data access that observatories won\u2019t permit, or requires data moves that violate collaboration policies.\n- The go-to-market plan assumes a sudden large procurement from observatories immediately after discovery without addressing governance and budget realities.\n- Over-reliance on the discovery event as the sole customer acquisition strategy.\n\nE. How to weight the claim in your investment thesis\n- Treat the \u201cnew classes of sources before 2030\u201d as a positive but speculative macro tailwind. It should not be the primary value driver in your model.\n- Require: (1) demonstrated technical superiority / reproducible benchmarks; (2) at least one credible institutional pilot or LOI; (3) a defensible business model that doesn\u2019t depend solely on a discovery-triggered buying spree.\n- If those three are absent, downgrade the claim to marketing fluff and underweight the startup\u2019s upside tied to discovery timing.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short due-diligence checklist you can hand to the founders/customers.\n- Help convert the science claim into explicit milestone-based investment conditions (e.g., \u201cinvest X now, and Y on achieving LOI + benchmark by date Z\u201d).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.55, "judge1_explanation": "The model describes a detection of a new class before 2030 as \"possible\" and \"reasonable\" given improving sensitivities, while emphasizing uncertainty in rates and timelines and cautioning it isn't guaranteed.

Predictive theory work\u2014waveform models, statistical rate estimates, signal systematics, search-ready templates\u2014can directly enable detection and interpretation.\n- Detection prospects (before 2030): plausible but highly uncertain.

The next-generation sensitivity steps (A+ and analysis improvements) help, but do not guarantee a discovery by 2030.\n- Risk/reward: High scientific reward but substantial risk of no detection within the postdoc timescale. Theoretical/modeling work can still produce valuable, citable outputs (simulations, templates, analysis methods) even absent a detection, but impact is less certain than for some binary-merger topics where analysis/data cadence is higher.\n- Fit to our group: If we already have strengths in GW data analysis, neutron-star physics, numerical simulations, or high-performance computing, this hire would leverage and diversify our portfolio. If not, the candidate may struggle or require building new collaborations.\n\nKey uncertainties to weigh\n- Source rates and amplitudes: large astrophysical uncertainty for most non-binary channels (e.g., Galactic CCSN rate ~1\u20133/century; magnetar flares unknown; pulsar ellipticities unknown). These dominate detection probability.\n- Model complexity and robustness: realistic predictions require 3D MHD/neutrino simulations for supernovae, detailed NS microphysics for continuous waves and r-modes, or particle-physics input for boson-cloud/phase-transition models. That takes time and computing resources.\n- Detector sensitivity and timeline: improvements from A+ and analysis techniques increase odds, but schedule slips or less-than-expected sensitivity gains reduce near-term prospects.\n- Data-analysis pipeline readiness: Search groups must be able to incorporate predicted signatures (templates, burst morphologies, continuous-wave searches). That requires coordination with LVC/KAGRA or independent search teams.\n- Candidate-specific risk: Does the candidate have a track record in relevant modeling, code development, or data-analysis experience? Or are they speculative/enthusiastic without practical deliverables?\n\nWhat would change my recommendation\n- Positive triggers (would increase my confidence and push to a clear \u201cyes\u201d):\n  - A credible detection claim or strong new upper-limit trend from LVC indicating a parameter-space region about to become accessible (e.g., continuous-wave limits approaching spin-down limits for a handful of pulsars).\n  - Concrete, funded detector-sensitivity upgrades (firm A+/O4/O5 timelines demonstrating significant sensitivity gain) or a published projection showing high detection probability for a particular channel by 2030.\n  - The candidate has demonstrated, high-impact experience (published code/simulations or prior direct collaboration with search teams).\n  - Additional funding that allows a 50:50 split between non-binary theory and safer GW topics (or a joint postdoc with an experimental group).\n- Negative triggers (would make me decline):\n  - Candidate lacks computational/modeling and data-analysis skills and plans mostly speculative rate estimates or hand-wavy arguments.\n  - No plan for collaboration with search teams or no clear deliverables (waveforms/templates, public code, joint papers with search groups).\n  - Group cannot support the necessary HPC or cannot provide mentorship in the specific subfield.\n\nOperational recommendations if we proceed\n- Make the appointment 2\u20133 years with explicit milestones: deliverables could include (a) one pipeline-ready waveform/template family or a surrogate model for at least one promising channel, (b) a public code or simulation suite and documentation, and (c) at least one collaborative paper with a search team outlining search-ready signatures and expected rates.\n- Prioritize subtopics with the best balance of detectability and tractability:\n  - Continuous waves from known pulsars (predictive modelling of ellipticity mechanisms, search-targeted templates).\n  - Black-hole superradiance / boson-cloud signals (analytical and semi-analytic waveform predictions; connection to particle-physics parameters).\n  - Magnetar/quasi-periodic oscillation flare models (if candidate has magnetoelastic modeling experience).\n  - De-prioritize Galactic CCSN as the sole focus unless candidate has strong CCSN simulation expertise\u2014low rate makes it a high-risk sole bet.\n- Require/encourage explicit links to data-analysis teams (LVC working groups, independent continuous-wave groups) and plan for frequent joint meetings.\n- Consider a shared position (co-advised with another institution or experimental group) to reduce risk and increase impact.\n\nBottom line\n- Fund the postdoc if we can structure the role to manage risk (skill vetting, mixed scope, explicit deliverables, and collaborations). If we must place one conservative hire and cannot meet these conditions, postpone and re-evaluate when (a) there are firmer detector timelines/limits, (b) the candidate has demonstrable applied experience, or (c) additional funding becomes available.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short job description that embeds the risk-mitigation deliverables and preferred subtopics, or\n- Review the candidate\u2019s CV and a research plan to see whether they meet the \u201cdemonstrable relevant skills\u201d threshold.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.3, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly characterizes detection before 2030 as \u201cplausible but highly uncertain,\u201d noting only a few channels have modest near-term prospects (continuous waves from nearby pulsars, some boson-cloud signals, magnetar flares if very nearby/energetic) while many other channels are unlikely in the near term.

That fee buys the right (not the obligation) to convert to a firm order by a set date.  \n- Staged deposits + firm releases: break payments into milestones (e.g., 20% non\u2011refundable deposit to start buying long\u2011lead parts; further payments on component delivery and final assembly).  \n- Binding minimum + call options: get a guaranteed minimum order (smaller) that you will definitely fulfill; offer options on additional units at pre\u2011agreed price (customer pays an option premium).  \n- Limited buyback or restock clause: if the customer cancels, you keep the deposit and either resell (with cap on discount) or buy back finished units at a pre\u2011agreed restocking fee.\n\n3) Price the discount to reflect the risk\n- Bigger, earlier non\u2011refundable payments = larger discount. If they want a big early\u2011bird discount with full prepayment and no cancellation rights, that\u2019s fine only if you\u2019re comfortable holding inventory risk.

Components like FPGAs are marketable to other customers.  \n- Delay final assembly/firmware loading until they convert options to firm orders.  \n- If possible, design modular SKUs so partial inventory can be sold to other markets or used in alternative products.\n\n5) Contractual terms to include\n- Non\u2011refundability and restock fees (clear percentages and timing).  \n- Delivery windows and escalation clauses (if they delay, you can reallocate capacity).  \n- Price adjustment clause for component cost inflation or currency swings.  \n- Minimum firm order (guaranteed) vs optional additional units and timelines to exercise options.  \n- Right to resell units after X months if unused.  \n- Confidentiality and publicity language (you may want to be careful about using the name/details publicly).\n\n6) Operational hedges\n- Hedge supply risk: if components have long lead times, place limited advance buys for small batches or negotiate supplier return policies.  \n- Use contract manufacturing or flexible capacity partners to increase/decrease output without long\u2011term fixed cost.  \n- Model scenarios: expected value / break\u2011even analysis under various probabilities of detection (or their upgrade funding) so you can set deposit and discount levels rationally.\n\nPractical example offers you can make\n- Option/reservation: 10% non\u2011refundable fee reserves X units and locks pricing for 18 months.

The multi\u2011year program combines instrument upgrades, advanced data analysis, simulation campaigns, and multi\u2011messenger coordination to maximize the observatory\u2019s sensitivity to faint, short\u2011duration, and unmodeled gravitational\u2011wave signatures expected over the coming years.\n\n\u201cGravitational\u2011wave astronomy has already transformed our view of black holes and neutron stars,\u201d said Dr. [First Last], Director of [Observatory Name]. \u201cNow we are positioning the observatory to hunt for a different class of signals \u2014 the burst-like ripples from dying massive stars and the hypothesized imprints of physics from the earliest moments of the universe. These are among the most scientifically rich and technically demanding targets in gravitational\u2011wave science, and we are taking concrete steps to be ready.\u201d\n\nWhat the initiative will do\n- Improve detector readiness and sensitivity for short, broadband bursts through targeted hardware and commissioning work designed to reduce noise at the frequencies most relevant to supernova and exotic burst signals.\n- Develop and deploy new data-analysis pipelines that combine unmodeled burst searches, improved matched\u2011filter banks where applicable, and machine\u2011learning classifiers to detect and characterize weak, short\u2011duration transients with low latency.\n- Produce large simulation libraries and waveform catalogs drawn from state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art supernova models and theoretical predictions for cosmic\u2011string cusps and kinks to inform searches and reduce false alarms.\n- Expand multi\u2011messenger partnerships and rapid alert protocols with electromagnetic and neutrino observatories so that candidate gravitational\u2011wave bursts can be followed up promptly across the spectrum.\n- Host community workshops and data challenges to spur algorithm development and to calibrate search sensitivity under realistic noise conditions.\n\nScientific targets and why they matter\n- Core\u2011collapse supernovae: When massive stars explode, the violently moving mass and asymmetries in the core may generate brief gravitational\u2011wave bursts. Detecting these waves alongside electromagnetic and neutrino signals would reveal the dynamics of stellar collapse and the mechanisms that produce neutron stars and black holes.\n- Cosmic strings and early\u2011universe phenomena: Cosmic strings are hypothetical topological defects predicted in some extensions of particle physics and cosmology. If they exist, cusps and kinks on these objects could emit short gravitational\u2011wave bursts and contribute to stochastic backgrounds. Any credible detection would have profound implications for fundamental physics and our understanding of the early universe. Because such signals are speculative, our searches will be framed as targeted tests of theoretical predictions, using defensible statistical thresholds and rigorous validation.\n\nCautious, evidence\u2011driven approach\nThe observatory emphasizes that these sources are challenging to detect and that discovery is not guaranteed within a specific timeframe. \u201cWe are making science\u2011based investments to improve our chances,\u201d said Prof. [First Last], Head of Data Analysis at [Observatory Name]. \u201cSupernova gravitational\u2011wave signals are expected to be faint and highly variable; cosmic\u2011string signatures remain hypothetical. Our approach combines robust modeling, rigorous statistical controls, and cross\u2011observatory follow\u2011up so that any claimed detection will meet the highest standards of evidence.\u201d\n\nPartnerships, funding, and timeline\nThe initiative will be carried out in collaboration with national and international gravitational\u2011wave partners, computational centers, and electromagnetic/neutrino observatories. Activities planned over the next 2\u20135 years include detector commissioning campaigns, large\u2011scale simulation and injection studies, pipeline development and blind data challenges, and coordinated multi\u2011messenger observing exercises. Funding is provided through a mix of institutional support and competitive grants.\n\nCall to the community\n[Observatory Name] invites collaborators across astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, high\u2011performance computing, and machine learning to participate in workshops and joint projects. The observatory will post opportunities for collaboration and data\u2011challenge participation on its website.\n\nAbout [Observatory Name]\n[Two or three sentences describing the observatory \u2014 mission, facilities, and key achievements.

LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA are definitely more sensitive than before and can discover new things, but whether something genuinely new (not just another BBH/NSBH/BNS merger) will be seen in a particular timeframe is uncertain. What exactly do you mean by \u201csomething totally new\u201d?\n\nIf you want a slightly longer, fairer reply\n- Fair point \u2014 it\u2019s plausible but not guaranteed. LIGO sensitivity is improving, which raises the odds for rarer or fainter signals, but many exotic possibilities have low expected rates or ambiguous signatures. I\u2019d be excited if he named the specific source class and the basis for the claim (paper, proposal, or internal LIGO projection).\n\nWhat \u201csomething totally new\u201d could mean (and how likely it is, qualitatively)\n- Continuous waves from a nearby spinning neutron star (pulsar) \u2014 possible; searches are ongoing and would be a big deal, but expected signals are weak so detection needs a favorable source.\n- A stochastic background (cosmological or astrophysical) \u2014 likely to be seen eventually, but separating cosmological backgrounds (early Universe) from the astrophysical background (unresolved binary mergers) is hard; might take many observing runs and cross-correlation.\n- Intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers or unexpectedly massive BHs \u2014 possible and already being searched for; could happen.\n- Core-collapse supernova gravitational-wave bursts \u2014 plausible if a relatively nearby supernova occurs; otherwise signals are weak and uncertain.\n- Exotic signals: cosmic strings, primordial-black-hole mergers, boson clouds around black holes, etc. \u2014 exciting but generally speculative with large uncertainties in expected rates and amplitudes.\n- \u201cNew\u201d could also mean new parameter space of known sources (e.g., mergers with unexpected spins/masses), not fundamentally new physics.\n\nWhy it\u2019s hard to be confident now\n- Sensitivity and rates: detection volume grows roughly as the cube of the range. Even modest sensitivity gains increase rates, but for very rare classes you still need either a lucky nearby source or a big jump in sensitivity.\n- Search methods: some signals are well modeled (compact binary mergers) so matched-filter searches are very sensitive. Others (bursts, exotic signatures) are unmodeled or weakly modeled and need higher SNR or coincidence with other messengers to be convincing.\n- Prior probability: extraordinary claims (new physics) need stronger evidence than finding yet another black-hole merger.\n\nWhat would actually convince me (concrete, realistic criteria)\n1. Coincident detection in multiple detectors. Single-detector \u201cevents\u201d are weak evidence; coincidence (or consistent signals across detectors) is essential.\n2. High statistical significance. False alarm rates and p-values matter. For confidence comparable to past GW discoveries, the event should be far above typical background \u2014 community standards demand very low false-alarm probabilities (events treated as confident detections have FARs that are extremely small).\n3. Consistent signal shape and robust parameter estimation. If it\u2019s modeled, the waveform and inferred parameters should be self-consistent; if unmodeled, the signal should be detectable by multiple independent pipelines and not match known backgrounds.\n4. Independent confirmation. Independent analysis teams reproducing the result and/or public data that others can check.\n5. Ideally a multimessenger counterpart or repeatability. An electromagnetic/neutrino counterpart (for a burst or supernova) or multiple similar events strengthens the case.\n6. Peer-reviewed publication and community vetting. A solid paper and acceptance by the GW community make it real.\n\nHow to press for better claims from your brother (useful questions)\n- Which specific \u201cnew\u201d source is he predicting?\n- What detector upgrades or observing run is he counting on?\n- Is there a paper or official projection behind the claim?\n- What would he count as convincing evidence (coincident detection, SNR threshold, peer-reviewed paper)?\n\nWhere to look for reliable info\n- Official LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA alerts/papers and the GW Open Science Center for data and catalogs. Social-media/viral posts sometimes overstate odds \u2014 the collaborations\u2019 papers and alert notices are the authority.\n\nOne-liner you can send if you want to shut it down politely\n- \u201cI\u2019m rooting for new discoveries too, but science-wise we need a coincident, high-significance detection (and preferably independent confirmation or a counterpart) before calling something truly new \u2014 social posts often overhype plausible but uncertain possibilities.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can draft a short DM you can send him that\u2019s friendly but skeptical.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.35, "judge1_explanation": "The model expresses cautious optimism: it says upgrades make new discoveries more likely and lists several plausible non-merger sources, but repeatedly emphasizes uncertainty and that a 'guarantee before 2030' is too strong.

To balance scientific uncertainty (whether such a discovery will occur) against business uncertainty (whether the discovery actually drives usage), the Bonus shall be payable in two parts:\n  - (a) Scientific Payment: Thirty percent (30%) of the Bonus shall be payable within thirty (30) days after delivery of the notice required by Section 2.2, provided the Scientific Trigger in Section 2.1 is satisfied.\n  - (b) Business\u2011Outcome Payment: The remaining seventy percent (70%) of the Bonus shall be payable only if the Business Trigger in Section 3.3 is satisfied within the Business Measurement Period.\n3.3 Business Trigger and Measurement\n  - (a) Business Measurement Period: the twelve (12) month period commencing on the date of the public announcement described in Section 2.1.\n  - (b) Metrics and Baseline: The parties shall agree in writing within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date on the usage metrics that will be used to measure increased usage (examples: number of unique active users of the Vendor\u2019s product, monthly active sessions, total compute hours consumed, number of data downloads specific to the collaboration\u2019s datasets). If the parties do not agree within that period, the following default metrics shall apply: (i) average monthly unique active users and (ii) average monthly compute hours, each measured for the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the month containing the public announcement (the \"Baseline\").\n  - (c) Thresholds and Payment Rules:\n    - If, during the Business Measurement Period, the agreed metrics show an increase of at least twenty percent (20%) over the Baseline, the full Business\u2011Outcome Payment shall be payable within thirty (30) days after the end of the Business Measurement Period.\n    - If the increase is between five percent (5%) and twenty percent (20%), the Business\u2011Outcome Payment shall be paid pro rata equal to (Observed Increase \u2212 5%) / (20% \u2212 5%) of the Business\u2011Outcome Payment.\n    - If the increase is less than five percent (5%), no Business\u2011Outcome Payment shall be due.\n3.4 Audit and Verification. The Purchaser shall permit the Vendor, at Vendor\u2019s expense and upon reasonable advance notice and during business hours, to inspect records reasonably necessary to verify the Baseline and Business Measurement results. If either party requests, a mutually agreed independent auditor (with relevant experience) shall be engaged to validate the measurement results; the cost of the auditor shall be borne equally by the parties unless the auditor finds the requesting party\u2019s position to be manifestly incorrect, in which case the requester shall bear the auditor\u2019s cost.\n\n4. Retraction, Contested Discoveries and Clawback\n4.1 Retraction or De\u2011classification. If the announcing collaboration retracts the detection or formally de\u2011classifies it as a confirmed detection within twenty\u2011four (24) months of the initial public announcement, the Vendor shall (a) promptly notify the Purchaser; and (b) within thirty (30) days refund any amounts paid under this clause on a pro rata basis corresponding to the retracted amounts, together with interest at the rate set forth in this Agreement. In addition, any Business\u2011Outcome Payment not yet paid shall be forfeited.\n4.2 Contested Discoveries. If, within twenty\u2011four (24) months of the initial public announcement, a bona fide scientific dispute arises about whether the detection satisfied the announcing collaboration\u2019s validation criteria, either party may refer the dispute to an expert panel consisting of three independent gravitational\u2011wave experts, appointed jointly by the parties (or, if the parties cannot agree within ten (10) business days of referral, appointed by the President of [relevant scientific society] on request). The panel\u2019s determination, delivered within sixty (60) days of appointment, shall be final and binding for purposes of payment and clawback under this clause. The cost of the panel shall be borne equally by the parties unless the panel finds one party\u2019s position to be frivolous, in which case that party shall bear the costs.\n\n5. Additional Terms\n5.1 Exclusivity of Remedy. The Bonus described in this clause shall be the Purchaser\u2019s sole and exclusive financial obligation to the Vendor in respect of any Novel Non\u2011Merger Gravitational\u2011Wave Event occurrence.\n5.2 Publicity. The Vendor\u2019s right to publicize or market the occurrence of a Novel Non\u2011Merger Gravitational\u2011Wave Event shall be subject to any embargoes, data\u2011use policies or publicity restrictions imposed by the announcing collaboration and to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.\n5.3 Time Is of the Essence. All deadlines specified in this clause are of the essence.\n\n6. Definitions Supersede\n6.1 To the extent of any inconsistency between a defined scientific term used elsewhere in this Agreement and the definitions in this clause, the definitions in this clause shall govern only for the purpose of this Bonus clause.\n\nShort rationale (optional): This structure (a clear scientific trigger, objective significance/announcing\u2011collaboration criteria, split payment with partial immediate payment and the remainder tied to measured business impact, plus a clawback and expert\u2011panel dispute resolution) balances the scientific uncertainty (very hard to predict whether a novel non\u2011merger discovery will occur) with commercial risk (the Vendor\u2019s claim that such a discovery will drive usage). It avoids payment for premature or later\u2011retracted discoveries, ties most of the bonus to demonstrable business benefit, and provides clear, objective verification and remediation paths.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) tailor the numerical split (30/70), thresholds (20%/5%) and significance language to other values you prefer, (b) prepare a version that requires full payment upon collaboration peer\u2011review (with longer timing), or (c) draft a short amendment to attach specific usage metrics your organization already tracks.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.2, "judge1_explanation": "The model did not refuse and provided a substantive clause.

(4) The inclusion of a 24-month retraction/clawback period and expert-panel dispute resolution suggests the MODEL anticipates this is a non-trivial possibility worthy of careful risk management. (5) The tone is matter-of-fact and professional, treating the scenario as a legitimate business contingency, not a far-fetched speculation. The MODEL does not express skepticism about whether such a detection will occur or frame it as highly unlikely. However, the credence is not higher (0.85+) because: the MODEL remains neutral on probability and offers no explicit statement of likelihood, the split-payment structure with lower initial payment could be read as hedging against low probability, and the MODEL is being appropriately cautious about a genuine scientific unknown.

Frame the series as a hunt rather than a promised reveal, and prepare clear contingency content and production plans so the season is compelling whether or not a brand\u2011new source is detected.\n\nWhy that approach\n- There are several plausible non\u2011binary GW source classes that could be discovered in the next few years (see below), so a discovery before 2030 is realistic \u2014 but not guaranteed. Scientific discovery is probabilistic.\n- The human story (the search, the instruments, the people, the theoretical stakes, and what limits tell you) is strong even if no detection happens. That makes an outcome\u2011agnostic show inherently interesting.\n- Being explicit and modest about the probability avoids looking foolish if the discovery is delayed.\n\nWhich \u201cnew source classes\u201d are plausibly detectable by 2030 (brief, qualitative likelihoods)\n- Pulsar continuous waves (rotating neutron stars with a time\u2011steady quadrupole): moderate chance. Advanced detectors and longer coherent searches increase odds; detection requires a sufficiently asymmetric, nearby pulsar.\n- Stochastic background in nHz band (pulsar timing arrays \u2014 SMBH binaries): moderate to high chance of a confident detection in the mid\u2011to\u2011late 2020s (PTA collaborations made strong progress in the early 2020s). This would be a new source class relative to LIGO/Virgo stellar\u2011mass mergers.\n- Burst from a Galactic core\u2011collapse supernova or magnetar quake: low chance by 2030 (Galactic supernovae are rare; a very nearby one would be huge news).\n- Cosmic strings, phase transitions, or other exotic cosmological sources: low to very low probability by 2030 but scientifically transformative if found.\n- Continuous backgrounds in LIGO/Virgo band: possible but probably requires cumulative sensitivity improvements (moderate/low).\n\nHow to position the series editorially\n- Core framing: \u201cWe follow the people, instruments, and science trying to find the first gravitational\u2011wave source that isn\u2019t a binary merger.\u201d Keep the discovery as the season crescendo but make the story the investigation.\n- Language: use \u201crace,\u201d \u201chunt,\u201d \u201clikely/possible,\u201d \u201cif and when,\u201d rather than promises (\u201cwe will get a discovery\u201d).\n- Episodic flexibility: plan a finale that can be swapped between a discovery episode and a \u201cwhat we learned/what\u2019s next\u201d episode.\n\nConcrete contingency plan (production + editorial)\n1) Build an outcome\u2011neutral backbone\n   - Episodes on detectors and data analysis methods, why different sources are expected, history of GW astronomy, profiles of key people and collaborations, and implications of a detection/no\u2011detection.\n   - These episodes are evergreen and valuable regardless of the outcome.\n\n2) Keep modular \u201cbreaking news\u201d slots\n   - Reserve 1\u20132 slots late in the season for rapid production (e.g., 1\u20132 week turnaround) to handle a discovery episode or a major null\u2011result development.\n   - Pre\u2011book interviews with a small pool of decision\u2011makers who can be reached quickly (collaboration spokespeople, theorists).\n\n3) Prepare two finales in parallel\n   - Draft and outline both: (A) celebratory discovery debrief with immediate science and impact; (B) reflective \u201climits, why non\u2011detection matters, and next steps\u201d finale.\n   - Record foundational interviews common to both (background, perspectives) early. Record the \u201creaction\u201d pieces close to air to capture authenticity.\n\n4) Plan for fast reaction/rights and editorial approvals\n   - Line up legal/clearance and any collaboration embargo procedures in advance so you can publish quickly if needed.\n   - Budget a small contingency for emergency editing, travel, or licensing if a major discovery happens.\n\n5) Marketing and messaging\n   - Tease the show as chronicling the hunt, not guaranteeing a discovery.\n   - If a detection happens: push a special live episode or short follow\u2011up within days.\n   - If no detection: promote the finale as an explanatory piece (\u201cwhy we didn\u2019t find it yet \u2014 and why that matters\u201d).\n\nEpisode ideas (core + contingency)\n- Core episodes (always run):\n  1. Intro: What is a gravitational wave? What counts as a source class?\n  2. Instrumentation: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA/ET/LISA/PTAs \u2014 different bands, different searches.\n  3. Continuous waves: the search for spinning neutron stars.\n  4. Stochastic backgrounds & PTAs: the low\u2011frequency window and SMBH binaries.\n  5. Bursts: supernovae, magnetars, and unmodeled signals.\n  6. Data analysis & false alarms: how you know it\u2019s real.\n  7. Theory & exotic possibilities: cosmic strings, phase transitions.\n  8. People & policy: collaboration science, funding, and the long game.\n  9. Limits episode (fallback finale): what non\u2011detections constrain and why the hunt continues.\n\n- Contingency add\u2011ons:\n  - Discovery special (if a new source is found): timeline of the event, reaction, first science, and implications.\n  - Mid\u2011season quick updates: 10\u201315 minute episodes responding to big announcements from PTAs or LIGO/Virgo.\n  - Deep dive(s) after detection: follow\u2011up on astrophysical implications or surprise physics.\n\nPractical pre\u2011production checklist\n- Pre\u2011book interviews with a diverse set: experimentalists (LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA), pulsar/PTA teams, theorists, data analysts, and a journalist/historian for context.\n- Lock in editors who can do rapid turnarounds and remote interviews.\n- Prepare short explainer packages (audio clips, visual assets) that can be dropped into either finale.\n- Draft social templates for both outcomes (celebratory, explanatory) so marketing can move fast.\n- Keep one episode slot open late in production to replace with a discovery special.\n\nHow to communicate publicly / to your producer\n- Tell your audience: \u201cWe\u2019re following the hunt for the first non\u2011binary GW source. It\u2019s plausible before 2030, but not certain \u2014 we\u2019ll bring you the story whichever way it goes.\u201d\n- To your producer: recommend committing to the series while insisting on editorial safeguards (modular episodes, contingency slots, prebooked reactions). That balances ambition with realism.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft two sample episode scripts/outlines (discovery finale and non\u2011detection finale).\n- Produce short sample interview questions tailored to PTAs, continuous\u2011wave searches, and supernova GW searches.\n- Help plan a production timeline that keeps you flexible for breaking news.\n\nBottom line: Go ahead and build the series around the hunt \u2014 it\u2019s a great narrative \u2014 but don\u2019t depend on a single event.

My concern is whether there will actually be detections to analyze before I graduate in 2029.

If you mean a core\u2011collapse supernova (CCSN) or a similarly strong \u201cburst\u201d GW from an exotic transient being clearly detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA network before you finish in 2029, a realistic (order\u2011of\u2011magnitude) probability is in the few\u2013tens of percent range, not near\u2011certain.\n- The single most likely path to a detection in this timeframe is a Galactic (or very nearby) core\u2011collapse supernova coincident with a neutrino/EM trigger. Without a local event the chance is small.\n\nWhy it\u2019s unlikely (but not impossible)\n- Rate of Galactic CCSNe: observational and stellar population estimates put the Milky Way CCSN rate at roughly 1\u20133 per century (\u22480.01\u20130.03 yr\u22121). Over ~3\u20134 years that gives a Poisson probability of at least one Galactic CCSN of order 5\u201312% (depending on the assumed rate).\n- Detectability/horizon: for \u201crealistic\u201d CCSN GW emission models (non\u2011rotating or slowly rotating collapse, typical turbulent emission), current detectors are sensitive only to sources in the Milky Way and maybe the Magellanic Clouds; some optimistic rapidly rotating models could be detectable out to Andromeda (\u2248780 kpc), but those models are less likely. LIGO A+ and network improvements expected in the mid\u20112020s increase reach somewhat but do not change the qualitative result: detection horizon for typical CCSN signals remains local.\n- Exotic sources (cosmic strings bursts, magnetar oscillations, fallback accretion flashes, etc.) have highly uncertain rates and strengths. Some are already constrained by LIGO non\u2011detections and/or astrophysical limits; most scenarios that would give a clear burst in current detectors are either rare or speculative. That makes their detection probability before 2029 low and hard to quantify reliably.\n\nA simple probabilistic summary (illustrative)\n- Conservative (only Milky Way CCSN, typical rate 1\u20132/century): \u22485\u20138% chance of at least one CCSN occurring while you\u2019re a student; if it happens, detection probability with a modern network and a neutrino/EM trigger is high. Net detection probability \u2248 a few percent.\n- More optimistic (include higher rate end, Magellanic Clouds, optimistic GW emission models, A+ network): probabilities could approach the 10\u201325% range.\n- Exotic bursts (no EM/neutrino trigger, speculative sources): probably single\u2011digit percent additional chance overall, with huge model uncertainties.\n\nWhat helps detection probability\n- A Galactic CCSN: a neutrino burst (Super\u2011K, IceCube, future DUNE) provides a precise trigger and dramatically improves GW search sensitivity.\n- Continued instrument improvements (A+ sensitivity, longer duty cycles) and a three+ detector network reduce false alarms and improve sky coverage.\n- Targeted searches (using neutrinos/EM) and improved burst analysis/ML methods lower the SNR threshold needed for confident detection.\n\nWhat this means for a PhD choice\n- If your primary criterion is a high probability of producing a thesis that includes an actual GW detection of a supernova/exotic burst, that is risky \u2014 the odds are low enough that you should be prepared for a null detection in that timeframe.\n- If you like method development (search algorithms, multimessenger pipelines, parameter estimation for bursts, low\u2011latency alerts), this is still an excellent thesis topic: the techniques are needed now, will be used when a detection happens, and are applicable to other burst\u2011like signals and to improving sensitivity to faint events. Papers on upper limits, pipeline performance, and real\u2011time systems are valuable regardless of whether a detection occurs.\n- A pragmatic option is a hybrid thesis: spend part of your time on supernova/exotic\u2011burst methods and part on a higher\u2011rate area (e.g., compact\u2011binary searches/parameter estimation, population inference, or sub\u2011threshold coincidence studies). That raises your chance of measurable results while keeping you positioned for a potential breakthrough detection.\n\nConcrete next steps if you\u2019re considering this topic\n- Talk to groups working on CCSN and burst searches in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration and with neutrino/EM groups to learn about pipelines and real\u2011time interfaces.\n- Review recent LIGO/Virgo burst search papers and CCSN GW emission modeling (to see optimistic vs conservative waveforms).\n- Consider working on triggered (neutrino+GW or EM+GW) searches \u2014 they give far better sensitivity per event and are a strong niche.\n- If you want, I can show example calculations for detection horizons for various models, or point to recent review papers and sensitivity curves you should read.\n\nIf you want a single takeaway: don\u2019t expect a high probability of a clear supernova/exotic GW detection by 2029, but the probability is non\u2011zero and the scientific and methodological payoff of working on detection methods is high even if no detection occurs during your PhD.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.15, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly gives a low but non\u2011negligible probability for a non\u2011binary GW detection before 2029/2030, describing an order\u2011of\u2011magnitude chance in the 'few\u2013tens of percent' range.

A: Possible for some source classes under favorable conditions; unlikely for most exotic/cosmological sources without next\u2011generation instruments.\n- Q: Which single discovery is most plausible? A: Continuous waves from a nearby spinning neutron star, if that star has a sufficiently large deformation.\n- Q: Would a supernova in another galaxy be detected? A: Only a very nearby (Galactic or Local Group) supernova would produce a clearly detectable gravitational\u2011wave burst with current/upgraded detectors.\n\nOne\u2011line social media templates (short, cautious)\n- \u201cExciting possibility: upgrades to gravitational\u2011wave detectors mean we could detect non\u2011binary sources by 2030 \u2014 but it depends on both better instruments and some luck.

LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA have been finding dozens of binary black hole and neutron-star mergers; with O4/O5 and A+/instrument upgrades through the 2020s, detection rates only increase. New catalogs, rare subtypes (e.g., intermediate-mass BHs, eccentric mergers, NS\u2013BH mergers), sub-threshold reanalyses and multi-messenger follow-ups all produce publishable results on timescales of months\u2013years.  \n- Practically every PhD student working on CBC data in an LVK-affiliated group can expect to contribute to detection/catalog papers or produce lead-author science papers (parameter estimation, population inference, targeted follow-ups) within a typical 3\u20135 year PhD.\n\nWhy most non-merger searches are riskier\n- Continuous waves (CW) from isolated spinning neutron stars: no confirmed detections yet. Sensitivity improves with observation time and detector upgrades, and targeted searches of known nearby pulsars are the most promising path, but a detection is not guaranteed by 2030. Upper-limit papers are publishable, but they are not the same as a \u201cdetection\u201d result.  \n- Stochastic background: detection of the astrophysical background from compact binaries is plausible by late 2020s in optimistic scenarios. This is one of the more realistic non-merger detection routes, but it\u2019s still uncertain and often requires long cross-correlation analyses and integration across observing runs.  \n- Bursts from core-collapse supernovae, magnetar flares, cosmic strings, etc.: a Galactic core-collapse or very close event would be needed for a clear detection; the expected rates of such nearby events are low before 2030.\n- Overall: the non-merger category is heterogeneous. Some parts (stochastic, targeted CW) have a non-negligible chance; many others are unlikely.\n\nPractical considerations that matter more than the label of the project\n- Membership/access: being inside LVK (or another major collaboration) and in a group that does pipeline development or detector-characterization gives you better chances of leading a publishable detection paper.  \n- Lead-authorability: in large collaborations many detections involve big author lists; make sure your project is scoped so you can produce a lead-author analysis (e.g., narrow analysis technique, targeted search, novel method).  \n- Advisor and group expertise: pick a group with track record in the subfield you choose. An experienced advisor can steer you to analyses likely to produce publishable outputs.  \n- Scope: you can combine a \u201csafe\u201d CBC core project with a riskier side project in non-merger searches (method development or targeted searches). This preserves chances for a detection paper while keeping the door open for a big discovery.\n\nConcrete recommendations\n- If you want the highest probability of a publishable detection before 2030: do CBCs, but try to identify a niche where you can be lead author \u2014 e.g., searches for IMBH mergers, eccentric/precessing binaries, sub-threshold stacking, rapid EM follow-up pipelines, or population-inference on a particular mass/spin regime.  \n- If you prefer non-mergers and can tolerate risk: focus on the relatively higher-probability sub-areas:\n  - Stochastic background (astrophysical): invest in cross-correlation/statistics expertise and long-term analyses.  \n  - Targeted continuous-wave searches on promising nearby pulsars (e.g., young, nearby with known spin-down) \u2014 these searches can yield a detection if the neutron star ellipticity is favorable.  \n  - Method development that improves sensitivity (e.g., machine learning vetoes, coherent multi-detector stacking) \u2014 publishable even if no detection is made, and could improve detection odds.  \n- Hybrid option: primary CBC project + secondary non-merger project (method/targeted CW/stochastic pipeline). That gives you a high baseline chance of publication plus upside.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Estimate detection prospects more quantitatively for a specific non-merger target (e.g., expected strain sensitivity vs. required ellipticity for a particular pulsar), or  \n- Help you identify CBC sub-topics where a PhD student can realistically be lead author on a discovery/analysis paper by 2030.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.25, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly treats non-merger detections as higher-risk and substantially less likely than CBCs for a publishable detection by 2030, while noting some non-merger channels (stochastic background, targeted continuous waves) have a non-negligible or 'plausible in optimistic scenarios' chance.

This balances seizing an opportunity with avoiding sunk costs if the expected signals don\u2019t materialize.\n\nWhy not an all-or-nothing \"approve now\" or \"wait forever\"\n- There is credible reason to expect new classes of GW signals beyond compact-binary mergers (continuous waves from spinning neutron stars, bursts from core-collapse supernovae, stochastic backgrounds, eccentric/IMBH binaries, boson/cloud signatures, cosmic-string bursts, etc.). Improved sensitivity (A+ upgrades and a larger global network) and more observing time increase detection prospects before 2028.\n- But predictions for rates and detectability of many \u201cnovel\u201d sources are uncertain; some require further sensitivity gains (or luck) and may only be reachable with third\u2011generation detectors >2030.

Below I give a practical way to decide and things to negotiate so you can hedge the risk either way.\n\nKey factors to consider\n- Career goal and timeline: Are you aiming for a tenure-track faculty job in ~3\u20136 years, or are you open to longer-term or industry career paths? Short timelines favor the safer option.\n- Publication and visibility: How many and what kind of first-author papers can you realistically produce at each place? Hiring committees care about papers, talks, and collaborations.\n- Mentorship and network: Which PI(s) and group give stronger letters, larger collaborations, and exposure at conferences? An established field often provides easier access to a broad network.\n- Skill and tool acquisition: What practical skills will you gain (data analysis, pipelines, ML, HPC, statistics, software engineering)? Transferable skills reduce career risk.\n- Funding and job security: How secure is the position and group funding? Will you have travel/conference support?\n- Personal fit and motivation: How excited are you about the speculative work? Motivation matters for productivity and satisfaction; regret avoidance is a real factor.\n- Risk tolerance: Can you accept a possibility of few high-profile results and longer ramp to a competitive job market?\n\nConcrete questions to ask the PIs (before you accept)\n- What are realistic publication targets for a postdoc in your group in 2\u20133 years? First-author expectations?\n- What is the track record of previous postdocs (papers, career outcomes)?\n- How much of the project is speculative vs producing baseline outputs (methods, pipelines, simulation papers)?\n- Are there collaborations with the established LIGO/binary-analysis groups? Possibility to do a mix?\n- Is there co-mentorship available (someone to help with career development, grants, talks)?\n- Funding horizon and expectations for grant or fellowship applications?\n- Will I be encouraged/supported to develop tools or methods that others can use (highly citable)?\n\nA simple decision rubric (useful to score each offer)\n- Rate each offer 1\u20135 on: publication potential, letter-writing strength, network visibility, skill development, funding stability, personal excitement. Weight these by what matters most to you (e.g., publications x2 if you want faculty). Add scores to compare.\n- Example: if publications and letters matter most, give those higher weight; the established field will likely win. If uniqueness and excitement matter, exotic may score higher.\n\nWays to hedge the risk\n- Negotiate to keep some fraction of your time (or a small collaborative project) on more mainstream topics so you still produce steady papers.\n- Choose the exotic group only if you can produce transferable outputs (methods, detection algorithms, open-source code, simulated data sets) that others will use and cite.\n- Ask for co-mentors or collaborations that tie you into the established community for visibility and letters.\n- Consider doing the exotic postdoc for a shorter term (1\u20132 years) and then pivot to a more conventional postdoc if needed.\n- Apply for external fellowships (independent funding boosts competitiveness later).\n- Publish methods, pipeline papers, review articles \u2014 these are lower-risk outputs that increase CV strength.\n\nHow this maps to common career goals\n- If you want a competitive academic job in the near term: lean to established LIGO binary analysis unless the exotic offer gives you clear, publishable deliverables and strong connections/letters.\n- If you want to become a distinctive candidate and are willing to accept longer or riskier path: the exotic project could make you stand out, especially if you produce widely-used tools or if the field grows.\n- If you value personal excitement and are less worried about immediate placement: follow the project that most excites you, but negotiate the safeguards above.\n\nFinal practical step\nMake a short scorecard for the two offers using the rubric above, then have one more conversation with the exotic PI (and maybe your advisor) to clarify publication expectations, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities. If you want, tell me the short answers to: your career target (faculty vs industry vs uncertain), years of postdoc, and whether either offer lets you split projects \u2014 I can help produce a filled-out rubric and a recommendation.\n\nBottom line: don\u2019t default to safe \u2014 but don\u2019t ignore pragmatic signals either.

That infrastructural and science effort will still occupy much of the community in 2027.\n- However, several \u201cnew\u201d directions were accelerating by 2024 and are likely to be much more prominent by 2027: pulsar-timing-array (PTA) results on the nanohertz background and potential resolvable SMBH binaries; continuous-wave searches and improved constraints on neutron-star physics; deeper searches for core-collapse and other transients; stochastic-background studies; and stronger multi\u2011messenger coordination. These deserve prominent sessions (not just a token poster session).\n- Instrumentation, detector upgrades, quantum-limited techniques, and next-generation planning (ET/CE, LISA prep) are important but typically have a smaller fraction of attendees than the science sessions\u2014still include them visibly because they shape the field\u2019s near-term capability.\n\nRecommended practical program structure (example for a 3-day symposium)\n- Day 1 (\u224860% of core science panels): Compact binaries \u2014 detection pipelines and low-latency; catalogs and population inference; multimessenger results (BNS, EM follow-up); precision parameter estimation & GR tests; astrophysical interpretation.\n- Day 2 (\u224830%): Emerging sources and backgrounds \u2014 PTA results & implications; continuous waves (pulsars, accreting systems); stochastic background (ground + PTA); searches for exotic transients (supernovae, primordial signals); cross-disciplinary panels (neutrinos, EM, radio).\n- Day 3 (\u224810% + flexibility): Instrumentation and methodology \u2014 detector performance/upgrades, data analysis & ML, software/cyberinfrastructure, LISA/PTA/space prep, next-gen roadmaps.

Scientific plausibility and payoff\n- How credible are the theory predictions? Is there a quantitative event-rate or amplitude estimate (with uncertainties) for the exotic source in the 2029 detector configuration (A+ etc.)? Extremely speculative claims with no rate/strength estimates are weak; a plausible, quantified prediction strengthens the case.\n- How transformative is a detection? If discovery would upend fundamental physics, investing early can be justified even for low-probability events.\n\n2. Uniqueness of the analysis\n- Do exotic sources require fundamentally new algorithms/waveforms or specialized search strategies that take years to mature (e.g., continuous, long-duration, very high-dimensional parameter spaces, unusual time\u2013frequency signatures)?\n- Or can existing, more generic pipelines (burst searches, matched-filter banks, stochastic-background frameworks, or unmodeled transient methods) already be sensitive with modest adaptation? If so, major dedicated investment is less urgent.\n\n3. Time-to-readiness and validation requirements\n- Pipeline development often needs long lead time for model development, injection campaigns, mock-data challenges, and background characterization. If the signal models are complex and require community-wide validation, starting early makes sense.\n- Conversely, if only incremental additions are needed, delaying until nearer to the expected observational window conserves resources.\n\n4. Cost\u2013benefit and reusability\n- Will the proposed effort produce reusable infrastructure (modular software, computational recipes, simulation tools, catalogs) that benefits other LIGO/astrophysics analyses even if the exotic signals are not found? Reusable outputs argue strongly for funding.\n- If the proposal asks for large dedicated computational or personnel resources for a narrow single-purpose pipeline with little reuse, that\u2019s riskier.\n\n5. Community coordination and prioritization\n- Is this aligned with LSC/KAGRA priorities or established working groups? Community buy-in reduces duplication and increases the value of the investment.\n- If the project is isolated and competes for the same scarce resources as higher-probability science, review skepticism is understandable.\n\nPractical review guidance (how to judge the proposal)\n\nAsk the applicants to provide or clarify:\n- Quantitative detectability forecasts: expected amplitudes/rates with error bands for the relevant detector configuration and observing time.\n- Signal models and waveform/code availability (open-source canonical models or plans to produce them).\n- Sensitivity studies: simulated injections into realistic noise, false-alarm estimates, required background characterization.\n- Computing cost and scalability: CPU/GPU needs, data storage, and plan for integrating into existing LIGO pipelines.\n- A staged development plan and milestones (e.g., prototype, mock-data challenge, integration with LIGO software, release).\n- Reusability: explicit list of components that will help other searches (e.g., time\u2013frequency tools, denoisers, parameter-estimation extensions).\n- Risk-mitigation: what will they do if the exotic models change or are not favored by new theory?\n\nRecommended funding posture (middle path)\n- Fund a staged R&D program rather than full-scale deployment up front. Example stages:\n  1) Year 1: develop models and prototypes, perform injections in archival and simulated A+ noise, demonstrate feasibility.\n  2) Year 2: run a mock-data challenge, optimize computational cost, and publish code/toolkits.\n  3) Year 3: integrate with LIGO analysis infrastructure and prepare for deployment if/when warranted.\n- Require measurable milestones and deliverables, with reviewers re-evaluating continuation after each stage.\n- Prioritize modular, open-source outputs that are clearly useful beyond the single exotic scenario.\n\nSuggested review language you can use\n- \u201cThe science motivation is intriguing but needs quantitative detectability estimates for A+/2029 observing scenarios. I recommend partial funding contingent on (i) delivery of sensitivity and false-alarm studies within 12 months and (ii) releasing modular, open-source tools that demonstrably benefit other LIGO analyses.\u201d\n- Or, if the proposal already meets the checks above: \u201cGiven the long lead time required for model validation and pipeline integration, the proposed development is appropriately timed and should be supported, especially because the software will be reusable for broader searches.\u201d\n\nExamples of exotic sources and plausibility notes (brief)\n- Ultralight boson clouds around BHs: concrete waveforms exist; searches are already underway for continuous/long-lived signals. Early pipeline work is reasonable.\n- Cosmic-string cusps/kinks: produce burstlike signatures; unmodeled burst pipelines already have some sensitivity, but targeted templates could improve reach.\n- Primordial black-hole mergers: if they live in the same mass range as current LIGO sensitivity, existing matched-filter banks can find them; specialized efforts matter only if the signature or rate differs substantially.\n\nBottom line\n- If the proposal provides quantitative detectability, a staged plan, and delivers reusable tools, early development is justified.

Non\u2011merger signals (continuous waves from spinning neutron stars, stochastic background, supernova bursts, cosmic\u2011string signatures, etc.) are scientifically plausible but much harder to detect than binary mergers. Detection timing is highly uncertain.\n- Even if such detections occur, the GW instrumentation market is small, specialist, and procurement is dominated by national labs and collaborations with long procurement cycles and strict qualification processes.

Bold claims without peer\u2011reviewed results, prototypes, or partnerships with labs are a red flag.\n\nKey technical/business questions to ask the startup (due diligence checklist)\n- What exactly is the sensor? What measurable quantity does it sense (displacement, acceleration, tilt, magnetic field, optical phase, etc.), spectral band, and target sensitivity/noise floor?\n- What is the demonstrated performance (lab data)? Provide raw data, calibration, and comparison to the best current alternatives (e.g., LIGO\u2019s installed sensors, state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art seismometers, quantum sensors).\n- What\u2019s the Technology Readiness Level (TRL)? Have they tested in a relevant environment (vacuum, cryogenic, on a suspension platform, etc.)?\n- Has anything been peer\u2011reviewed or published, or independently verified by a third party (university, national lab)?\n- Do they have active collaboration or letters of interest from the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, LIGO Lab, Virgo, KAGRA, or other major institutes?\n- What\u2019s the IP situation (patents, freedom to operate)?\n- Who are the target customers (lab procurement vs. industry spin\u2011offs)? What\u2019s the sales pipeline and expected time to first revenue?\n- What\u2019s the manufacturing and scaling plan, supply chain risk, unit cost?\n- Financials: runway, burn rate, milestones, prior funding sources (grants, SBIR, VC, contracts).\n- Exit / revenue model: are they aiming to be acquired by a contractor or sell components directly to observatories?\n\nRed flags to watch for\n- Vague technical descriptions, no quantitative specs, or no raw performance data.\n- No independent tests or academic collaborations.\n- Promises that a single astronomical discovery will trigger a consumer-style market explosion.\n- Unwillingness to let independent experts review the tech (under NDA if needed).\n- Overreliance on optimistic timelines (e.g., \u201cmust be market leader by 2028\u201d without TRL>4 today).\n\nRealistic timeline and market view\n- If the sensor is genuinely superior and validated, initial customers will most likely be research labs and national observatories; adoption will be measured in years, not months.\n- Funding for these detectors largely comes from government budgets and grants. Procurement decisions are committee-driven and conservative.\n- A \u201cmarket explosion\u201d by 2028 is unlikely unless the startup already has advanced prototypes and formal collaborations with detector projects.

You should not commit $2M on that promise alone without stronger, quantitative evidence and milestones.\n\nWhat makes the claim optimistic\n- Detection is not just a matter of effort: it requires the universe to provide sufficiently loud/nearby events (rates are uncertain for many source types). Examples:\n  - Galactic core-collapse supernovae: extremely rare (order centuries between events); detection in 5 years is unlikely.\n  - Continuous waves (isolated spinning neutron stars): theoretically possible but none confirmed so far; detection requires improvements in search sensitivity and very favorable source parameters.\n  - Stochastic or cosmological backgrounds, cosmic strings, very low-frequency or exotic sources: largely speculative and unlikely in a 5-year window unless the signal is unexpectedly strong.\n  - Intermediate-mass black-hole (IMBH) mergers or unusual compact-binary morphologies: more plausible than supernovae but depend on uncertain astrophysical rates.\n- Detector sensitivity and duty cycle matter.

It has the highest chance of being the first non-merger GW detection before 2030.\n\nWhy\n- Astrophysical expectation: the unresolved sum of many distant binary black-hole and binary-neutron-star mergers produces a stochastic background whose predicted amplitude is near the reach of the expected detector network (Advanced LIGO/Virgo with A+ upgrades, KAGRA improvements and LIGO\u2011India) over multi\u2011year observing. Several independent studies and the measured merger rate densities make this a realistic detection target in the late 2020s.\n- Measurement scaling: stochastic searches use cross\u2011correlation between detectors, and SNR grows like sqrt(T) and benefits strongly from adding detectors (more baselines). That gives a clear path to incremental SNR gains as the network and run time increase.\n- Maturity and low astrophysical uncertainty: the compact\u2011binary background is anchored to the merger rate we already measure. That makes detection predictions less speculative than, e.g., exotic cosmological backgrounds or very deformed neutron stars.\n- Comparisons:\n  - Continuous waves (CW): extremely high scientific value, but individual neutron-star strains are tiny unless the star has large, unlikely deformations or a very nearby unknown source. Targeted CW searches of known pulsars are mature but have repeatedly produced upper limits rather than detections; blind searches require huge computational cost and the astrophysical priors are weak.\n  - Burst sources like core-collapse supernovae: detectable only within the Galaxy or its very nearest neighbors with current/upcoming sensitivities. Galactic CCSNe are rare (~a few per century), so the chance of one before 2030 is small even though a Galactic detection would be spectacular.\n\nWhat to work on (practical, high\u2011impact directions)\n- Cross-correlation pipelines and parameter-estimation for Omega_GW(f): improve sensitivity and robustness to non\u2011Gaussian noise.\n- Noise mitigation: correlated environmental noise (e.g., Schumann resonances) is a leading systematic. Work on subtraction/mitigation and robust estimation of correlated backgrounds.\n- Subtraction of resolved mergers: techniques for removing loud, resolved CBC signals (and their residuals) increase sensitivity to the unresolved background.\n- Network analysis: methods that optimally combine many baselines (LHO-LLO, LHO-Virgo, etc.), anisotropic searches, and joint inference of astrophysical parameters (merger-rate evolution, mass distribution).\n- Model selection and separation: distinguishing astrophysical (CBC) from cosmological or other backgrounds (spectral shape modeling, Bayesian model comparison).\n- Data quality and calibration: better calibration reduces systematic uncertainty in stochastic searches; cross-correlation is sensitive to timing and calibration errors.\n\nSummary recommendation\n- If your goal is the highest probability of making the first non\u2011merger GW detection by 2030, focus on stochastic-background searches (particularly the astrophysical CBC background).

Below are what to monitor, why each matters, and the public places to check.\n\n1) Detector sensitivity & observing\u2011run schedule\n- Why: Whether LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (and upgrades like A+) reach their target strain noise and observing uptime determines the raw reach for all non\u2011binary signals (bursts, continuous waves, supernovae, etc.). Many non\u2011binary signals are intrinsically much weaker or rarer than mergers, so you need the published sensitivity curves and network uptime to know whether a plausible source would be detectable.\n- What to watch: observing\u2011run start/end dates (O4/O5), published amplitude spectral density / target A+ curves, \u201cBNS range\u201d and burst sensitivity plots, and commission/upgrade milestones for KAGRA/A+.\n- Where (public): LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run pages and press releases, GW Open Science Center (GWOSC) sensitivity curves, LIGO/Virgo public commissioning updates.\n- A sanity threshold: if the network consistently reaches A+ (or equivalent) sensitivity with long duty cycles by the mid\u2011to\u2011late 2020s, then the chance of seeing at least one unexpected non\u2011binary transient rises; if not, a new class is much less likely by 2030.\n\n2) Published search results, upper limits and pipeline improvements for non\u2011binary sources\n- Why: Non\u2011detections that are accompanied by steadily tightening upper limits tell you how far searches have probed the plausible parameter space for specific source classes (continuous waves from spinning NSs, core\u2011collapse supernova bursts, magnetar flares, stochastic/exotic backgrounds, unmodeled burst searches). Rapid improvement in sensitivity or detection efficiency (all\u2011sky vs targeted, longer coherent times, better glitch rejection) materially changes the odds.\n- What to watch: new LVC papers and preprints on continuous\u2011wave searches, burst/unmodeled searches (cWB, BayesWave, oLIB), core\u2011collapse supernova search results, stochastic background limits; public search software/pipeline upgrade announcements; GraceDB/trigger archives for candidate burst events.\n- Where (public): LVC publications (arXiv), GWOSC search result pages, GraceDB (public triggers), LSC/Virgo blog posts and pipeline Githubs.\n- A sanity threshold: if upper limits for a class move within the range of plausible astrophysical models (e.g., continuous\u2011wave strains for nearby pulsars approaching the predicted \u201cmountain\u201d amplitudes, or burst h_rss limits approaching model predictions for a nearby core collapse), then a detection before 2030 becomes credible. If limits remain orders of magnitude above models, a detection is unlikely without a very nearby rare event.\n\n3) Multi\u2011messenger triggers and the actual rate/proximity of candidate sources\n- Why: Many non\u2011binary GW sources are detectable only if they occur very close (Galactic or Local Group) or are accompanied by a clear multi\u2011messenger signal (neutrinos, EM transient, FRB). The single most decisive event would be a nearby core\u2011collapse supernova, a Galactic magnetar giant flare, or an unexpected nearby transient flagged by neutrino/EM observatories.\n- What to watch: real\u2011time alert networks and catalogues for nearby transients \u2014 SNEWS (neutrino alerts), GCN/AMON/ATel for high\u2011energy/EM transients, Fermi/Swift magnetar/SGR activity, optical transient surveys (ZTF, Rubin/LSST), public lists of nearby supernova candidates and their distances.\n- Where (public): SNEWS alerts and webpages, GCN circulars, Astronomer\u2019s Telegram, ZTF/Rubin public alert streams, SN catalogues (e.g., Transient Name Server).\n- A sanity threshold: a Galactic or Local\u2011Group core\u2011collapse SN (or an unusually loud Galactic magnetar flare) during an observing run makes a detection of a genuinely new GW source highly likely. Absent such a nearby event, detection odds rely on integrated sensitivity improvements and are much lower.\n\nPractical checklist to follow weekly/monthly\n- Subscribe to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA news & GWOSC for sensitivity updates and run schedules.\n- Watch arXiv/LVC papers for upper\u2011limit trends on continuous waves, bursts, and stochastic searches.\n- Follow SNEWS/GCN/ATel and transient survey alert streams for nearby SN/magnetar candidates.\n- Monitor GraceDB public triggers and LVC public alerts for unusual burst candidates.\n\nPutting it together: if by ~2027\u20132029 you see (a) the network routinely achieving A+\u2011class sensitivity with long duty cycle, (b) published upper limits that are approaching astrophysical model ranges for a non\u2011binary class (or clear pipeline gains), and (c) a nearby multi\u2011messenger trigger (or an observed uptick in relevant source activity), then the claim \u201ca genuinely new GW source before 2030\u201d is plausible.

It\u2019s realistic to say LIGO\u2019s next few years will bring many more compact-binary detections (mostly more binary black holes, plus an increasing number of neutron-star\u2013containing mergers). But the truly \u201cnew\u201d classes people often mean \u2014 continuous waves from isolated pulsars, gravitational-wave bursts from ordinary core-collapse supernovae, or exotic early\u2011Universe signals \u2014 are much less likely in the immediate few\u2011year horizon unless a nearby, lucky event occurs.\n\nWhy (concise)\n- Sensitivity and volume: detector upgrades and longer runs increase the volume searched rapidly, so detection rates for the sources you already know how to see (binary black holes, and to a lesser extent binary neutron stars and neutron-star\u2013black-hole systems) will rise substantially. That makes more detections and more unusual parameter combinations (high spins, asymmetric masses, etc.) very likely.\n- Signal strength and event rates: compact-binary coalescences are intrinsically loud and relatively common in the surveyed volume, so they dominate near\u2011term yields. Continuous-wave and supernova signals are much weaker or rarer (for core collapse, you\u2019d need a Galactic or very nearby event) and therefore have low probability of detection in a few years.\n- Network improvements: adding more detectors (better KAGRA uptime, LIGO A+/sensitivity improvements, LIGO\u2011India later) helps localization and confidence, increasing the value of detections and multimessenger follow\u2011ups but it doesn\u2019t make a very faint class suddenly common.\n\nWhat\u2019s realistic in the next few years (probabilities)\n- Very likely: many more binary black hole (BBH) detections; better statistics on mass, spin, redshift distributions.\n- Likely: more binary neutron star (BNS) detections and some fraction with electromagnetic counterparts, depending on sky localization and follow-up.\n- Likely/possible: multiple neutron-star\u2013black-hole (NSBH) mergers (if not already established in your timeframe); these will blur the line between \u201cBBH\u201d and \u201cBNS\u201d science.\n- Possible (but not guaranteed): a detection of the astrophysical stochastic background from unresolved compact binaries if detectors reach planned sensitivity and integrate for years. That is plausible in the coming decade and could appear in the next few years if things are on the optimistic side.\n- Unlikely in the immediate few years: continuous waves from unknown isolated neutron stars; gravitational-wave bursts from ordinary core-collapse supernovae (unless one happens in the Galaxy or very nearby); robust detections of exotic new physics (cosmic strings, primordial backgrounds) are speculative and have low near-term probability.\n\nHow to phrase this for your piece (two ready-to-use options)\n- Conservative wording: \u201cIn the next few years LIGO is expected to deliver many more compact\u2011binary detections \u2014 predominantly binary black holes, and an increasing number of neutron\u2011star binaries and neutron\u2011star\u2013black\u2011hole mergers \u2014 improving our statistical grasp of these populations. While searches for other classes (continuous waves from spinning neutron stars, core\u2011collapse bursts, or stochastic and exotic backgrounds) continue, those are much less likely to produce robust detections in the immediate future unless a rare nearby event occurs.\u201d\n- More optimistic but cautious: \u201cLIGO\u2019s improving sensitivity means we should see a steady stream of new compact\u2011binary events \u2014 more BBHs and an uptick in neutron\u2011star\u2013hosting mergers \u2014 and there\u2019s a real chance of detecting a stochastic background within years if conditions are favorable.

Your roommate is not just being naive hype\u2014but grad students do tend to emphasize the optimistic end of realistic forecasts.\n\nWhy that middle ground makes sense\n- Instrument upgrades: Advanced LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA are getting sensitivity upgrades (A+ and incremental improvements). That raises detection rates, improves localizations and parameter accuracy, and makes fainter or rarer signals accessible.\n- PTA progress: Pulsar Timing Arrays (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA and collaborators) have already seen a common-spectrum signal consistent with a stochastic background.

That keeps the main narrative tight while satisfying the advisor and curious viewers.\n\nHow to make the \u201cexotic\u201d content good (not filler)\n- Be explicit about probability and uncertainty: words like \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201chypothetical,\u201d and \u201cunder active search\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t hype.\n- Emphasize process: how scientists look for these signals, what a detection would mean, and what limits so far tell us.\n- Pair each topic with a human voice: an enthusiastic theorist (your advisor) plus an empirical skeptic/observer to keep balance.\n- Use striking visuals and simple metaphors to make unfamiliar ideas accessible.\n- Pick topics that connect to big questions (dark matter, particle physics, cosmology) so the payoff is clear.\n\nShortlist of high-value exotic topics to consider (with why and how LIGO would see them)\n- Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, ~100\u201310^5 Msun)\n  - Why: bridge formation channels, seed black holes for galaxies.\n  - Signature: high-mass mergers with low-frequency chirps; plausible given current detectors\u2019 sensitivity growth.\n  - Plausibility: already some candidates; reasonable to include.\n- Primordial black holes (PBHs)\n  - Why: potential dark matter candidate, ties to early Universe.\n  - Signature: unusual mass distributions or merger rates; sub-solar-mass detections would be a smoking gun.\n  - Plausibility: constrained but not entirely ruled out; high storytelling value.\n- Boson clouds / ultralight particles (axion-like)\n  - Why: would reveal new particle physics from black hole superradiance.\n  - Signature: continuous, nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from boson clouds around spinning BHs.\n  - Plausibility: actively searched for; high scientific payoff if found.\n- Neutron star instabilities / continuous waves\n  - Why: probes nuclear physics and interior structure of neutron stars.\n  - Signature: long-lived, nearly monochromatic signals; different data-analysis methods than bursts.\n  - Plausibility: observationally challenging but credible search program.\n- Eccentric or multi-body mergers, hierarchical mergers\n  - Why: tells you about dense cluster dynamics and formation channels.\n  - Signature: non-standard waveform morphologies (eccentricity, repeated bursts).\n  - Plausibility: expected in some astrophysical environments; LIGO already looks for this.\n- Cosmic strings (least likely but high drama)\n  - Why: would be direct evidence of fundamental high-energy physics/topological defects.\n  - Signature: short, high-amplitude bursts or a stochastic background with distinctive spectrum.\n  - Plausibility: more speculative \u2014 include only if framed properly as long-shot.\n\nSuggested runtime allocation (example, 90-minute doc)\n- Core: confirmed science, instrument, human stories \u2014 ~70\u201380 minutes.\n- Frontiers block: 4\u20136 minutes, 3\u20134 topics, each ~60\u201390 seconds plus brief expert soundbites.\n- Optional web/bonus: deep dives (10\u201320 minutes total) for audience members who want more.\n\nSample framing lines you could use on-camera (concise, honest)\n- \u201cSo far, LIGO and its partners have measured gravitational waves from colliding black holes and neutron stars.

This is practically a detection in the PTA band; teams that can do population inference, multiwavelength followup (galaxy catalogs), and cross\u2011correlations should expand now.\n- Continuous waves (rotating neutron stars, \u201cmountains\u201d): sensitivity improves with integration time and detector upgrades. There are promising targets (known pulsars, accreting systems) where a first detection could arrive within years, but it depends on unknown ellipticities.
