But \u201ctallest\u201d can mean other things, so the safest approach is to be explicit about which measure you mean.\n\nWhich authoritative sources to consult\n- Nepal\u2019s Department of Survey \u2014 they led the 2020 re-survey of Everest and published the official Nepalese number.  \n- China\u2019s national surveying agency (the joint Nepal\u2013China announcement, Dec 2020).  \n- Peer\u2011reviewed geodesy literature and technical reports on the 2020 survey (GPS/GNSS methodology, ellipsoid/geoid used). Look in journals like Journal of Geodesy or technical reports from national mapping agencies.  \n- International reference data from:\n  - NASA (Earth Observatory, SRTM data and missions)  \n  - USGS (mountain elevation background and mapping)  \n  - IERS / WGS84 documentation (for definitions of distance to Earth\u2019s center and datums)  \n- Encyclopaedia Britannica or National Geographic for clear lay explanations and comparisons.  \n- Guinness World Records (for \u201chighest mountain\u201d records, but check their definition and source).  \n- Mountain/geography specialist sites for alternate measures (Peakbagger, Peaklist) when checking prominence or base-to-summit claims.\n\nWhat to check in those sources (a quick verification checklist)\n- Which definition of \u201ctallest/highest\u201d is being used (above mean sea level; from base; farthest from Earth\u2019s center; topographic prominence).  \n- The datum/geoid/ellipsoid used (e.g., mean sea level vs WGS84). That affects wording about \u201cabove sea level\u201d vs \u201cdistance from Earth\u2019s center.\u201d  \n- Date and method of measurement (e.g., the 2020 Nepal\u2013China GNSS survey, older surveys, satellite/altimetry). Earthquakes can change heights slightly.  \n- Any uncertainty or margin of error stated.\n\nKey factual distinctions you may want to use on-air\n- Highest summit above sea level: Mount Everest. (Latest joint Nepal\u2013China announcement put Everest at 8,848.86 m.)  \n- Tallest measured from base to summit: Mauna Kea (Hawaii) \u2014 about 4,207 m above sea level but ~10,200 m from its base on the ocean floor to the summit.  \n- Farthest from the Earth\u2019s center: Chimborazo (Ecuador) \u2014 because Earth is an oblate spheroid, Chimborazo\u2019s summit is the point on Earth\u2019s surface farthest from the center, even though its elevation above sea level (~6,263 m) is less than Everest\u2019s.  \n- Most topographically prominent: Everest is also the most prominent (prominence = height of summit\u2019s rise above the lowest contour encircling it and no higher summit).\n\nExact on-air wording you can use (short and safe)\n- If you want a short correction that preserves the guest\u2019s intent:\n  - \u201cThat\u2019s true if you mean \u2018highest above sea level\u2019: Mount Everest\u2019s summit is the highest point on Earth above mean sea level.\u201d  \n- If you want to be precise and add the current official figure:\n  - \u201cMount Everest has the highest summit above mean sea level \u2014 currently listed at 8,848.86 meters according to the 2020 Nepal\u2013China survey.\u201d  \n- If you want to contest or broaden the claim (one-liner):\n  - \u201cDepends on your definition: Everest has the highest summit above sea level, but Mauna Kea is taller if you measure from base to summit, and Chimborazo\u2019s summit is the farthest from Earth\u2019s center.\u201d  \n- If you want a concise on-air correction with sources:\n  - \u201cEverest is the highest mountain above sea level (Nepal\u2013China survey, 2020). But \u2018tallest\u2019 can mean different things \u2014 e.g., Mauna Kea is tallest from base to summit, Chimborazo is farthest from Earth\u2019s center.\u201d\n\nA slightly longer script for a fact-check segment\n- \u201cFact-check: When people say \u2018Everest is the tallest mountain,\u2019 they usually mean \u2018highest above sea level,\u2019 which is correct \u2014 Everest\u2019s summit is the highest point on Earth above mean sea level (8,848.86 m, per the 2020 Nepal\u2013China survey). But \u2018tallest\u2019 can mean other things: by height from base to summit, Mauna Kea is larger (about 10.2 km from its submarine base), and because the Earth bulges at the equator, Chimborazo\u2019s summit is actually the farthest point from Earth\u2019s center. So Everest is the highest above sea level, but not the sole possible meaning of \u2018tallest.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf you need to cite quickly on air or in text\n- Cite the Nepal Department of Survey / the joint Nepal\u2013China announcement (Dec 2020) for Everest\u2019s current official height. For comparisons, cite NASA/USGS and National Geographic articles explaining Mauna Kea and Chimborazo distinctions, or reputable geodesy sources.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Pull up the exact press release citations and links (Nepal/China 2020) and a couple of accessible articles (NASA, National Geographic) you can read on-air.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model affirms that, under the common definition 'measured from mean sea level,' Mount Everest has the highest summit and even cites the 2020 Nepal\u2013China survey value.
