Two are branchial hearts that pump deoxygenated blood to the gills; the third is a systemic heart that receives oxygenated blood from the gills and pumps it to the rest of the body.\n- Physiology note: Octopus blood uses copper-based hemocyanin for oxygen transport (it appears blue). When an octopus swims, the systemic heart may slow or stop temporarily, which is why sustained swimming is more tiring for them than crawling.\n- Scope: This applies to octopuses and, more broadly, to many cephalopods (squid and cuttlefish have similar heart arrangements).
