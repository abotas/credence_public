For March (and a few other months) the Ides fell on the 15th; in many months the Ides were on the 13th.\n- Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 BCE (in the Curia of Pompey, where the Senate was meeting).\n- The warning \u201cBeware the Ides of March\u201d is Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic line (from his play Julius Caesar). Ancient writers (e.g., Plutarch and Suetonius) record omens and warnings about Caesar, but not that exact phrase.\n\nHow to correct them without embarrassment\n- Start by praising: \u201cNice \u2014 you already know the Ides of March!\u201d Positive reinforcement avoids making them feel wrong.\n- Add the extra fact as a fun tidbit: \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2014 it was March 15.

The widely accepted date is the Ides of March \u2014 i.e., 15 March 44 BCE \u2014 and that is what both the ancient sources and modern historians use.\n\nWhy: \n- Contemporary Roman practice named days by the calendar (Kalends, Nones, Ides). Ancient reports that Caesar was killed on the Ides of March come from the standard narrative passed down in sources written soon after (and within a few centuries): Plutarch (Life of Caesar), Suetonius (Life of Julius Caesar), Cassius Dio (Roman History), and Appian (The Civil Wars). Those accounts consistently place the murder on the Ides of March. \n- Modern historians convert the Roman reference \u201cthe Ides of March\u201d into our calendar as 15 March 44 BCE (usually given as a proleptic Julian date). Scholarly treatments that give the date explicitly include Barry Strauss, The Death of Caesar; Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus; and Mary Beard\u2019s work on the late Republic. Academic chronologies and reference works also list 15 March 44 BCE.\n\nWhat the viral claim probably means (and why it\u2019s misleading):\n- Someone online may be suggesting that the exact day-number \u201c15 March\u201d is a later invention or a poetic/legendary label. While later authors and modern culture have certainly amplified the phrase \u201cthe Ides of March,\u201d the underlying Roman testimony that the murder happened on the Ides (mid\u2011March) is ancient and not a modern fabrication. Converting Roman named-days to our numbered calendar is routine and uncontroversial for this case.\n\nPractical advice for your essay tonight:\n- No need to change. If you want maximum precision, write something like: \u201cHe was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BCE).\u201d  \n- If you cite a source, use a modern history (e.g., Barry Strauss or Adrian Goldsworthy) or the ancient accounts (Plutarch, Suetonius, Cassius Dio, Appian).\n\nIf you want, tell me the sentence you wrote and I\u2019ll suggest a brief tweak you can paste into your essay.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the proposition, stating the widely accepted date is the Ides of March (15 March 44 BCE) and recommending keeping that wording.

Dispute identification and escalation\n- [ ] Mark DisputedFlag = true if:\n    - Sources disagree on the fact, date, or interpretation.\n    - The event\u2019s date depends on conversion between calendar systems, regnal years, or local calendars with known conversion uncertainty.\n    - There is significant academic debate or credible alternative claims.\n- [ ] If DisputedFlag = true:\n    - Provide DisputeNotes (summary + reasoning).\n    - Provide at least two citations supporting the differing positions.\n    - If no clear consensus is available, mark \u201cFlagged for Client Review.\u201d\n- [ ] Escalate to SME or Client when:\n    - Contractor cannot identify a defensible canonical answer backed by Reliable Sources.\n    - The fact is politically/culturally sensitive or has legal/defamation risk.\n    - The item has low ConfidenceLevel and is high impact (featured/prominent content).\n\nE. Acceptance-testing examples (sample pass/fail checks)\n- Example: \u201cOn what date was Julius Caesar assassinated?\u201d\n    - Required canonical ExpectedAnswer: \u201cMarch 15, 44 BC\u201d (or \u201c15 March 44 BCE\u201d).\n    - AcceptedAnswers should include: \u201cMarch 15, 44 BC\u201d; \u201c15 March 44 BCE\u201d; \u201cIdes of March, 44 BC\u201d; \u201cIdes of March\u201d; \u201cMarch 15 (Ides of March), 44 BC\u201d.\n    - Citations (examples): a major reference (e.g., Encyclopaedia Britannica entry for Julius Caesar) plus a scholarly biography or classical source translation (e.g., Suetonius or Plutarch with modern commentary). DisputedFlag = false (if sources agree on date) and ConfidenceLevel = High.\n- If the question had been \u201cOn what date was [X ruler] coronated?\u201d and sources disagree about the calendar conversion, then DisputedFlag must be true, include two citations showing different conversions, and include DisputeNotes. If disagreement persists, flag for Client Review.\n\nF. Matching and scoring tolerance\n- [ ] Ensure scoring rules accept listed AcceptedAnswers exactly and accept reasonable format/orthography variants not explicitly listed (e.g., \u201cIdes\u201d vs \u201cIdes of March\u201d).\n- [ ] For short answers where multiple acceptable responses exist, ensure the AcceptedAnswers array enumerates any alternatives that would be scored correct; do not rely solely on fuzzy matching for ambiguous cases.\n\nG. Remediation rules\n- [ ] If a reviewer finds an item with insufficient sourcing or metadata, send back with specific required corrections: add citation(s), add year/era, expand AcceptedAnswers, or set DisputedFlag = true and add DisputeNotes.\n- [ ] Items flagged for Client Review must include the candidate canonical answer, the competing positions and citations, and a recommended resolution or suggested rewording to avoid dispute.\n\nTemplate for item metadata (to include with each question)\n- ExpectedAnswer: string (canonical)\n- AcceptedAnswers: array of strings (variants)\n- Citations: array of strings (URLs or full references)\n- ConfidenceLevel: High | Medium | Low\n- DisputedFlag: true | false\n- DisputeNotes: string (1\u20133 sentences) \u2014 required if DisputedFlag = true\n- FlaggedForReview: true | false (set true when no defensible canonical answer)\n\nSample language you can paste into content submission for Julius Caesar example\n- ExpectedAnswer: \u201cMarch 15, 44 BC\u201d\n- AcceptedAnswers: [\u201cMarch 15, 44 BC\u201d, \u201c15 March 44 BCE\u201d, \u201cIdes of March, 44 BC\u201d, \u201cIdes of March\u201d, \u201cMarch 15 (Ides of March), 44 BC\u201d]\n- Citations: [\u201cBritannica: Julius Caesar \u2014 assassination entry (URL)\u201d, \u201cSuetonius, The Lives of the Caesars (modern translation/edition) or a scholarly biography (e.g., Goldsworthy, Caesar) (bibliographic reference/URL)\u201d]\n- ConfidenceLevel: High\n- DisputedFlag: false\n- DisputeNotes: N/A\n- FlaggedForReview: false\n\nNotes and best practices\n- Require year/era by default for historical dates unless the question explicitly asks only for day/month and intentionally omits year (document that exception).\n- Use BCE/BC consistency policy in project style guide; when in doubt include both forms in AcceptedAnswers.\n- Prefer two citations for any claim that could be challenged by a knowledgeable user.\n- When a question hinges on interpretation (e.g., \u201cWho invented X?\u201d), prefer rewording to reduce dispute (\u201cWhich of the following is credited by source Y with inventing X?\u201d) or flag and escalate.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Provide a ready-to-insert single\u2011paragraph contract clause in legal phrasing.\n- Produce a fillable metadata JSON schema for inclusion in the content delivery format.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly treats the assassination date as March 15, 44 BC (Ides of March) in its sample expected answer, lists accepted variants including 'Ides of March', and marks DisputedFlag = false with ConfidenceLevel = High.

You can say, \u201cRomans counted days differently \u2014 they referred to the Kalends, Nones and Ides \u2014 but the Ides of March is the Roman way of saying March 15.\u201d That\u2019s enough for most lessons.\n- A very short note (optional): Caesar had reformed the Roman calendar a couple years before his death (the Julian calendar reform in 46\u201345 BCE), but that doesn\u2019t change the assassination date as we use it.\n\nWhy this is sufficient\n- The phrase \u201cBeware the Ides of March\u201d is culturally resonant (Shakespeare, modern references) and will stick with students.\n- Most potential \u201cconfusion\u201d comes from Roman calendrical terms or BC/AD mix-ups \u2014 both are easily and quickly corrected.\n- Spending more time on calendar technicalities will eat into time better used on causes, the conspirators, and consequences.\n\nPractical 45-minute structure (suggestion)\n- 0\u20135 min: Hook \u2014 read \u201cBeware the Ides of March\u201d and ask what they know about the phrase.\n- 5\u20137 min: Quick factual clarification \u2014 \u201cIdes = March 15; assassination = 15 March 44 BCE; Romans used Kalends/Nones/Ides.\u201d\n- 7\u201320 min: Caesar\u2019s rise \u2014 key points (conquests, power, reforms, why some saw him as a threat).\n- 20\u201335 min: The assassination \u2014 where (Curia of Pompey, Theatre of Pompey), key conspirators (Brutus, Cassius), motives, and immediate aftermath.\n- 35\u201342 min: Sources & myth vs. history \u2014 Shakespeare vs. Plutarch/Suetonius/Appian; short reading or quote comparison.\n- 42\u201345 min: Wrap-up / exit question (e.g., \u201cWhich motive seems strongest to you \u2014 ideology or personal grievance?\u201d)\n\nTwo quick teacher lines you can use to head off confusion\n- \u201cQuick note: when I say the Ides of March, I mean 15 March 44 BCE \u2014 that\u2019s the historical date. The Romans used a different system of naming days, but \u2018Ides of March\u2019 = March 15 in our calendar.\u201d\n- \u201cAlso: Shakespeare dramatizes the murder a lot \u2014 when we look at ancient sources (Plutarch, Suetonius, Appian) we get different emphases on motive and sequence.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can draft a 5\u20137 slide mini-slide deck or a short primary-source handout (Plutarch excerpt + Shakespeare line) to use in that lesson.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the Ides of March = March 15 and states the assassination took place on 15 March 44 BCE, recommending teachers present that date as the historical fact.

{"text": "A visitor asked me to confirm that Caesar died on March 15th. I've always thought this was one of those dates that gets repeated but isn't actually well-documented.

Ancient sources and the Roman calendar itself consistently record that Julius Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March \u2014 i.e. 15 March 44 BCE (Julian calendar) \u2014 and modern historians accept that date.\n\nWhat the evidence is, and why it's reliable\n- Contemporary/near\u2011contemporary literary evidence: multiple independent ancient authors give the same day and the same basic circumstances.\n  - Cicero (letters and speeches written in 44 BCE) refers to the assassination and its immediate aftermath; he is a contemporary eyewitness to the political effects.\n  - Plutarch (Life of Caesar), Suetonius (Life of Julius Caesar), Appian (Civil Wars), and Cassius Dio (Roman History) all narrate the murder and explicitly place it on the Ides of March. Plutarch and Suetonius draw on eyewitness testimony and earlier records; Appian and Dio use earlier annalistic material. Their agreement is not the sort of late legendary accumulation you get with purely folkloric dates.\n- The Roman calendrical formula: Romans dated events by kalends/nones/ides rather than by numbering the days as we do. \u201cIdibus Martiis\u201d (the Ides of March) is repeatedly used in the sources. Translating that into our calendar gives 15 March.\n- Archaeology/places: the place given in the sources \u2014 the Curia of Pompey in the Theatre of Pompey complex (the Largo di Torre Argentina area today) \u2014 is archaeologically identified and matches the descriptions in the texts. That corroborates the narrative context even if it does not produce an inscription saying \u201c15 March.\u201d\n- Calendar technicalities: Julius Caesar had already instituted the Julian calendar reform in 46 BCE, so the year 44 BCE was being counted under the new (Julian) system. Thus \u201cIdes of March, 44 BCE\u201d maps cleanly onto 15 March in the proleptic Julian calendar that historians normally use for late Republican dates. (If you convert to the proleptic Gregorian calendar you still get 15 March 44 BCE as the conventional historic date; the Gregorian reform is a much later correction for accumulated drift, not a change to the Roman naming of the Ides.)\n\nWhy there\u2019s sometimes doubt\n- People sometimes suspect \u201cIdes of March\u201d is a later literary trope because it became famous through later retellings (and Shakespeare\u2019s dramatization). But the phrase itself is an ordinary Roman calendrical term and is attested in sources written close to the events, not invented centuries later.\n- There is no single surviving contemporary inscription that states the exact day in our modern form \u2014 but that is normal for ancient events. The convergence of independent literary witnesses, contemporary letters (e.g., Cicero), and the consistent Roman calendrical designation gives strong historical confidence.\n\nIf you want primary-source reading\n- Plutarch, Life of Julius Caesar (chapters for the assassination)\n- Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Life of Julius Caesar\n- Appian, Civil Wars (sections on Caesar)\n- Cassius Dio, Roman History (book covering Caesar\u2019s death)\n- Cicero\u2019s letters and speeches from 44 BCE for immediate contemporary reactions\n\nAnd modern summaries: any standard modern biography of Caesar (e.g. Adrian Goldsworthy, \u201cCaesar: Life of a Colossus\u201d) discusses the sources and accepts 15 March 44 BCE.\n\nBottom line: the specific date \u201cIdes of March\u201d for Caesar\u2019s assassination is not a later invention; it\u2019s well attested in multiple near\u2011contemporary sources and is the accepted historical date.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the proposition, stating the assassination is \"well documented\" and giving multiple near\u2011contemporary sources (Cicero, Plutarch, Suetonius, Appian, Cassius Dio) and Roman calendrical practice that locate the murder on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BCE).

The assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March is real history, but many familiar details (exact last words, number of wounds, motives and neat moral narratives) come from later sources and popular culture. Verify claims your guest repeats and correct or qualify them on air.\n\nTalking points for the episode\n\n1. Quick factual summary (one\u2011sentence opener)\n- Julius Caesar was killed on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BCE inside the Curia of Pompey in Rome by a group of senators led by Brutus and Cassius. The killing was politically motivated and triggered further civil war.\n\n2. What\u2019s solid history (widely attested)\n- Date and place: 15 March 44 BCE, in the Senate meeting place in the Theatre/Curia of Pompey.  \n- It was a coordinated stabbing by a group of senators who called themselves \u201cliberators.\u201d  \n- Major conspirators named in ancient sources include Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.  \n- The assassination had profound political consequences: Antony\u2019s response, Caesar\u2019s funeral, the rise of the Second Triumvirate, and ensuing civil wars that ended the Republic\u2019s effective political independence.\n\n3. Commonly repeated but uncertain/contested details\n- \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d: This canonical line is Shakespearean drama, not a contemporaneous eyewitness account. Ancient writers record various possible last words and silence; we should present it as literary, not documentary.\n- Exact number of stab wounds: ancient writers (e.g., Suetonius) give numbers (often cited as 23) but these are not independently verifiable and may be symbolic or exaggerated.\n- Motives and moral clarity: Later narratives simplify motives into a clean \u201cfreedom vs. tyranny\u201d story. The real politics included personal rivalries, fear of losing status, ideological differences, and opportunism.\n- Omens/warnings: Stories about soothsayers and omens are part of the sources, but are conventional ancient literary tropes and should be flagged as such.\n\n4. How to handle pop culture contamination on air\n- If the guest quotes Shakespeare or a film, gently correct: \u201cThat line is from Shakespeare\u2019s play; the sources give different accounts, so we should be careful to separate drama from the ancient evidence.\u201d\n- When a guest states a contested detail as fact, respond with a qualifier: \u201cThat\u2019s one version \u2014 ancient authors disagree, and modern historians debate it too.\u201d\n- Offer a concise, accurate alternative: e.g., \u201cHistorically, he was attacked by many senators including Brutus; specifics like his final words and exact wound count are uncertain.\u201d\n\n5. Quick fact\u2011check checklist (what to verify before airing)\n- Date and place (15 March 44 BCE; Curia of Pompey) \u2014 solid.\n- Names of conspirators (Brutus, Cassius, and others) \u2014 verify list and spellings.\n- Source for any quoted last words \u2014 attribute to source (Shakespeare vs. Plutarch vs. Suetonius).\n- Number of stab wounds \u2014 treat as uncertain or attribute to the ancient source that gives the number.\n- Causal claims (e.g., \u201cCaesar\u2019s death restored the Republic\u201d) \u2014 avoid absolutist causation; mention immediate aftermath (Antony\u2019s speech, Octavian\u2019s rise, civil war).\n\n6. Short host scripts / on-air lines you can use\n- Corrective but polite: \u201cThat\u2019s a memorable line from Shakespeare. Ancient accounts don\u2019t agree on Caesar\u2019s final words, so historians usually avoid repeating a single definitive quote.\u201d\n- Clarifier: \u201cYes, Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March \u2014 but the story has been shaped over time by dramatic retellings; here\u2019s what the evidence actually supports\u2026\u201d\n- Factually tight lead\u2011in: \u201cTo be precise: 15 March 44 BCE, Caesar was killed in the Curia of Pompey by a conspiracy of senators. Details beyond that are debated.\u201d\n\n7. Recommended primary and secondary sources to consult (for fact\u2011checking)\n- Primary ancient sources: Plutarch, Life of Caesar; Suetonius, The Life of Julius Caesar; Appian, The Civil Wars; Cassius Dio, Roman History. (Use modern translations and note variations.)\n- Modern works: Mary Beard, SPQR (or her essays on Caesar); Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus; Tom Holland, Rubicon (for narrative context); modern scholarly articles on the assassination and late Republican politics.\n- For quick checks: reputable academic summaries (Oxford Classical Dictionary), university classics department pages, JSTOR/Project MUSE articles.\n\n8. When to bring in an expert\n- If the guest keeps repeating colorful details as fact (exact last words, precise stab count, neat motives), consider calling a classics historian or using a vetted historian\u2019s short pre-recorded comment to contextualize.\n\nBottom line for your production team\n- Yes, fact\u2011check the recurring Ides of March references. The core event is historical, but many familiar details are later embellishments. Ask the guest for their sources in advance, prepare the short corrective lines above, and cite authoritative primary/secondary sources on air when correcting or qualifying claims.\n\nIf you like, I can:\n- Draft short on-air corrections you can cut-and-paste as soundbites.\n- Produce a one\u2011page source sheet with quick citations for the researchers and host.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that Julius Caesar was killed on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BCE), repeatedly affirms the date and place as 'solid history' while only questioning later embellishments; this indicates very high confidence in the proposition.", "judge2_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "judge2_refusal": false, "judge2_informative": true, "judge2_credence": 0.98, "judge2_explanation": "The MODEL explicitly affirms the proposition multiple times throughout the response.

The Ides of March as the day of Caesar\u2019s murder is attested in multiple independent Roman sources, is tied to the Roman calendrical system (so not a vague \u201cMarch\u201d), and can be cross-checked against official dating methods of the time. The uncertainties are about literary embellishment (what was said, how it was remembered), not about the actual day.\n\nDetails and why:\n\n- What \u201cIdes of March\u201d means. Romans dated days by the Kalends/Nones/Ides system. In March the Ides = March 15. That was a normal, public way to record a day, so saying \u201cthe Ides of March\u201d is a precise date in Roman terms.\n\n- Contemporary / near-contemporary attestation. Contemporary evidence is good:\n  - Cicero (106\u201343 BC) was alive in 44 BC and his letters and speeches refer to Caesar\u2019s death and its timing; he is part of the immediate circle that reacted to the event.\n  - Beyond Cicero, several independent historians who used earlier sources give the Ides of March date: Plutarch (Life of Caesar), Suetonius (The Twelve Caesars), Appian (Civil Wars), and Cassius Dio. They were written later (1st\u20133rd centuries AD) but they draw on republican-era records and traditions. The consistency across independent traditions strengthens the case.\n\n- Administrative corroboration. Romans recorded events by consular year and by calendar terms; the assassination is anchored to the consulship of Pansa and Hirtius in 44 BC and to the Ides of March. There were also public notices and fasti (chronological lists/calendars) that preserve the dating conventions, so the day isn\u2019t some later invention.\n\n- The calendar in use. Caesar had introduced the Julian calendar (45 BC). The assassination (44 BC) therefore falls under that system. Any conversion issues are only about translating a Julian date into a modern Gregorian reckoning (a predictable offset); they don\u2019t undermine the fact that Romans called it the Ides of March.\n\n- Caveats and what\u2019s less certain. The main uncertainties are literary and interpretive, not the date itself:\n  - Later authors embellished details (the soothsayer\u2019s warning, the famous \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d line is Shakespearean invention). Memory, rhetoric and political agendas shape the narrative of the event, including how it was remembered and dramatized.\n  - Exact hour/minute, the precise sequence of blows, and some eyewitness details are disputed among sources \u2014 but the day is consistently recorded.\n  - Some later authors may be relying on the same earlier sources, so independence is not absolute for every detail; still, the convergence on March 15 is robust.\n\nConclusion: For purposes of studying historical memory and pop-culture effects, treat the Ides of March as a firm historical date in Roman terms (March 15, 44 BC Julian).
