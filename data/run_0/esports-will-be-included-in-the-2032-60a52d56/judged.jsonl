For a small tournament operator to materially benefit you need (a) a high probability that esports actually becomes an Olympic medal event by 2032, (b) the operator to hold or win valuable rights/positioning tied to that inclusion (not just general market exposure), and (c) realistic monetization paths and margin/scale improvements. Treat \u201cOlympic-scale growth\u201d as an optional, low-probability, long-dated upside in your valuation unless the operator already controls rights or irreplaceable assets.\n\nChecklist of the key things to weigh\n\n1) Probability and timing of the catalyst\n- IOC politics and processes: Is esports likely to move from recognition/demonstration to a full medal sport by Brisbane 2032? What are the IOC\u2019s public signals and the timeline for decisions?\n- Which game(s) would be included? Medal status usually applies to a specific discipline/title; the IOC won\u2019t adopt \u201cesports\u201d generically.\n- Publisher consent and control: Publishers often own/approve competitive formats \u2014 do the relevant publishers support Olympic inclusion?\n- Precedents in multi-sport events: Has esports already been included at continental Games / Commonwealth / Asian Games (and how was impact measured)?\n\n2) Who captures the value\n- Rights and exclusivity: Does the operator have (or reasonable chance to win) rights to stage Olympic qualifiers, regional events, or a branded Olympic pathway? A small operator with no rights will likely be bypassed by big rights-holders or publishers.\n- Relationships with publishers, federations, and national Olympic committees: Are there confirmed MOUs or long-term agreements?\n- Competitive landscape: Would global/invested incumbents, publishers, or broadcasters step in and marginalize small operators?\n\n3) Market/monetization realism\n- Audience uplift vs. conversion: Olympic exposure can raise awareness, but will that translate to higher paying viewers, sponsors, and rights revenue for this operator?\n- Sponsorship and broadcast economics: Who negotiates rights for Olympic esports content \u2014 IOC, publisher, national bodies? How are sponsorships allocated?\n- Revenue streams and ARPU: Ticketing, sponsorship, media rights, merchandising, franchise fees \u2014 what realistically scales and with what margins?\n- Geographic mix: Olympic impact is global; can the operator scale internationally or are they local/regional?\n\n4) Operational and financial scalability\n- Technology and production capability: Can the operator meet broadcast-quality production, anti-cheat, integrity, and anti-doping standards required by major events?\n- Cost to scale: Capex, staffing, venue/logistics, compliance. Olympic-level production is expensive and margins can compress.\n- Unit economics and operating leverage: How do incremental events scale profitably? Is there meaningful margin expansion when volume increases?\n\n5) Structural risks and frictions\n- Publisher/IP risk: Publishers can change game rules, decline to participate, or re-route rights to partners.\n- Fragmentation of esports titles: The Olympics may pick 1\u20133 titles; most operators run many titles \u2014 catalysts will be title-specific.\n- Regulatory and integrity challenges: Gambling, match-fixing, and doping rules could complicate inclusion and sponsorship.\n- Timing mismatch: Benefit might be realized only close to 2032 (or post-2032) \u2014 discount rate and capital needs matter.\n\n6) Exit and investor return considerations\n- Who would buy the business post-Olympics? Strategic buyers likely include publishers, broadcasters, or large organizers \u2014 would they need this operator\u2019s assets?\n- Dilution and capital raises: Can the operator fund scale-ups without excessive dilution?\n\nHow to fold this into valuation (practical approach)\n- Scenario / probability-weighted model:\n  - Build at least three scenarios: base (no Olympic catalyst), Olympic happens but operator doesn\u2019t capture much, Olympic happens and operator captures meaningful rights.\n  - Assign probabilities to each scenario based on your view of IOC + publisher support + operator\u2019s ability to capture rights.\n  - Project incremental revenues, margins, and capex for the \u201cOlympic wins\u201d scenario and discount to present value.\n- Sensitivity analysis:\n  - Vary key drivers (probability of inclusion, share of Olympic-related market captured, sponsorship ARPU, margin) to see valuation sensitivity.\n- Real option framing:\n  - Treat the Olympic outcome as an option: limited initial investment may buy you optionality, but heavy upfront spending to \u201cposition\u201d for Olympics is risky unless probability is high.\n- Break-even check:\n  - Compute how big the uplift must be to justify current price (e.g., \u201cIf Olympic inclusion increases revenues by X% with Y% margin and has probability p, then present value uplift = ...\u201d).\n\nDue diligence questions to ask management\n- Do you have signed agreements, MOUs, or exclusivity with publishers, national federations, or Olympic bodies?\n- Which specific titles are you positioned to host? Do those publishers support Olympic inclusion?\n- What rights (regional/qualifier/broadcast/sponsorship) do you currently have or realistically expect to win?\n- Can you show unit economics for staging large events at Olympic production quality?\n- What capital and time would be required to scale for a Brisbane-2032-level event?\n- What anti-fraud, anti-doping, and integrity processes are in place or planned?\n- What are the main competitors and how would they respond?\n- Are there contractual clauses that would transfer Olympic-related revenues to publishers or larger partners?\n\nRed flags that the \u201cOlympic\u201d story is hype\n- No publisher or federation agreements; reliance on speculative \u201cif esports is included, we\u2019ll get business.\u201d\n- Management plans to fund large-scale scaling primarily through equity raises without clear milestones.\n- Expectation that Olympic inclusion automatically translates to 5\u201310x revenue without concrete rights or distribution routes.\n- Operating track record limited to small/local events with no broadcast/production experience.\n\nQuick example calculation framework (high level)\n- Current revenue = R0. Base-growth CAGR = g0 \u2192 base-case revenues to 2033.\n- Olympic-case incremental revenue in 2032 = R0 * uplift_factor (e.g., if operator captures qualifiers + sponsorships, uplift might be 1.5\u20133x for that year; choose range).\n- Assign probability p that this Olympic-case materializes.\n- Incremental PV uplift \u2248 p * (NPV of incremental cash flows from 2032 onward \u2013 incremental capex).\n- Compare incremental PV to current market cap to assess materiality.\n\nBottom line recommendation\n- Don\u2019t fund a valuation premium for \u201cOlympic-scale growth\u201d unless the company has clear, documented assets or near-certain paths to rights and publisher/IOC support.\n- Treat Olympic inclusion as a tail upside and model it explicitly with probabilities and sensitivities.\n- If you still want exposure: prefer investments in companies that already control key rights, have publisher partnerships, or have proven ability to scale event production and monetize audiences \u2014 otherwise the odds favor larger incumbents capturing the upside.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Help build a simple three-scenario model template you can plug numbers into.\n- Suggest specific questions tailored to a particular operator\u2019s pitch deck or contracts.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.2, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly calls Olympic inclusion a \"low-probability, long-dated upside\" and repeatedly frames it as a tail event contingent on several hard-to-get conditions (IOC politics, publisher consent, rights capture).

The IOC has run esports-related events (Olympic Esports Week, virtual series, exhibitions) and shown interest, but inclusion as a medal event for Brisbane 2032 is not confirmed and would be uncertain even if considered.\n- Even if esports get Olympic recognition at some point, only a tiny fraction of players reach the very top. Like traditional pro sport, it\u2019s high-risk/high-reward.\n\nHow to talk with your teen (tone + sample lines)\n- Start by validating: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re excited about something you care about.\u201d\n- Ask curious, open questions: \u201cWhat draws you to the Olympic pathway? Which games, teams, or coaches are involved? What would success look like for you in 1, 3, and 8 years?\u201d\n- Reflect back and add your perspective softly: \u201cI can see you\u2019re motivated. I also worry about long-term options and the risk of giving up other things that help you now.\u201d\n- Offer partnership, not shutdown: \u201cLet\u2019s try to make a plan that gives you enough practice to improve while also keeping school, health, and some other activities in place. If we treat this like a real career pathway, what commitments will you make to earn that support?\u201d\n\nPractical framework to set expectations (use as a trial plan)\n1. Define short- and medium-term goals (concrete, measurable)\n   - Examples: improve rank to X, win X open tournaments, get scouted by a semi-pro team, maintain school GPA \u2265 X.\n2. Agree on a trial period (3\u201312 months) with regular check-ins (monthly)\n   - Review metrics, wellbeing, social life, sleep, school grades.\n3. Keep core commitments (non-negotiables)\n   - School performance threshold (e.g., GPA or grades in key subjects).\n   - Minimum physical activity (3\u00d7/week or specific sport/club) to avoid sedentary harms.\n   - Sleep hygiene (set bed/wake times).\n4. Limit and schedule practice reasonably\n   - Start with a realistic hour/week target that increases gradually. Avoid all\u2011day sessions that impair school or health.\n5. Financial and travel boundaries\n   - Be explicit about what you\u2019ll pay for (gear, entry fees) and what you won\u2019t (expensive coaching or travel without clear evidence of return).\n6. Review & exit criteria\n   - Define what success looks like and what would prompt scaling back (e.g., fall in grades, burnout, no progress after X months).\n\nBenefits to emphasize so they don\u2019t feel shut down\n- Transferrable skills: teamwork, communication, strategy, time-management, reaction time, and potentially opportunities for scholarships or industry jobs (streaming, coaching, game dev).\n- There are college programs and scholarships for esports; many career options besides becoming a pro player.\n\nRisks to discuss calmly\n- Very low probability of reaching the top; careers are short and volatile.\n- Online toxicity, burnout, sleep and posture issues, potential for gaming to crowd out education and friendships.\n- Financial costs for reliable gear, travel, coaching, and tournament fees.\n\nHow to evaluate claims and opportunities (quick checklist)\n- Who is organizing the pathway? Reputable teams/colleges/organizations?\n- What tournaments/leagues will they enter? Are they open, recognized, and have clear advancement routes?\n- Is there credible coaching and sports science (nutrition, physical training, mental health support)?\n- What are realistic success percentages and typical timelines for players in that program?\n- Are there testimonials/track records you can verify (past players\u2019 outcomes)?\n\nAlternate pathways to support the dream without betting everything\n- Keep one or two extracurriculars (especially physical/social ones).\n- Encourage streaming/content creation, which can build an audience and income regardless of tournament results.\n- Explore esports scholarships, local clubs, university teams, part\u2011time coaching for younger players.\n- Teach business/safety: contracts, sponsorships, tax basics, online safety.\n\nSample short conversation structure you can use\n1. \u201cI\u2019m proud you\u2019ve found something you care about.\u201d\n2. \u201cHelp me understand: what are the specific steps in this Olympic esports pathway and what successes look like.\u201d\n3. \u201cI want to back you, but I need a plan that keeps school and health on track.

These show operational feasibility and competitive legitimacy.\n  - Publisher pilot events alongside big multisport events or agreements to provide sanitized versions of games.\n  - Why they matter: indicate interest and operational examples but not binding.\n- Medium-strength signals\n  - One or more major publishers signing formal agreements on IP/competition rules and anti\u2011cheating/anti\u2011doping compliance.\n  - Formation or consolidation of a single, credible, WADA\u2011compatible global esports federation (or coalition) with clear governance and athlete representation.\n  - Positive Programme Commission assessment or recommendation to the IOC Executive Board that esports meet Olympic criteria (values, universality, governance, cost, anti\u2011doping).\n  - Explicit support from the Australian Olympic Committee and host government in official submissions.\n  - Why they matter: resolve critical blockers (IP, governance, anti\u2011doping) and indicate formal pathway toward IOC approval.\n- Strong/decisive confirming signals\n  - Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee officially proposes esports to the IOC as an additional sport for Brisbane 2032 (in the formal submission).\n  - IOC Executive Board and/or IOC Session publicly approves esports for the Brisbane 2032 programme (vote or formal decision).\n  - Formal inclusion in the official Olympic sports list, athlete quotas allocated, and reimbursement/scheduling integrated into the Games plan.\n  - Why decisive: these are binding actions that put esports on the programme.\n\nWhat to treat as strong disconfirming evidence\n- Formal IOC rejection or explicit IOC Executive Board/IOC Session vote against including esports for Brisbane 2032.\n- Brisbane 2032 or Australian Olympic Committee publicly states they will not propose esports (or the host contract excludes additional sports beyond a defined list).\n- Persistent inability to create unified governance acceptable to the IOC/WADA (multiple competing IFs, refusal to accept WADA rules, or GAISF rejection).\n- Major publishers refuse to sign binding agreements covering IP use, competition rules, anti\u2011cheating, and athlete protections \u2014 especially if the publishers control the titles most played worldwide.\n- WADA (or the IOC) finds esports governance non\u2011compliant with anti\u2011doping requirements or esports bodies fail to obtain WADA compliance status.\n- High\u2011profile, unresolved integrity crises in the esports ecosystem (widespread match\u2011fixing, systemic doping, major security/cheating scandals) that persist and are not credibly addressed.\n- Legal/regulatory prohibitions in Australia or conditions in the host agreement that make esports competitors ineligible (e.g., gambling or violent content restrictions that the IOC deems incompatible and cannot be mitigated).\n- Strong, organized opposition from a majority of NOCs or continental associations leading to a collective stance against esports inclusion.\n\nHow to weigh conflicting signals\n- Official IOC documents > host or IF statements > media reports > advocacy pieces. When the IOC or IOC Programme Commission speaks formally, treat that as decisive unless later reversed at Session.\n- A host\u2019s formal proposal is necessary but not sufficient; the IOC still must approve. Conversely, absence of a host proposal seriously lowers probability even if other signals are positive.\n- Governance and publisher agreements are gatekeepers: even if the host and IOC are friendly, lack of publisher cooperation or WADA compliance is a practical showstopper.\n- Demonstration/medal status at continental events is persuasive evidence of operational feasibility and public acceptance but does not substitute for IOC governance criteria.\n- Treat repeated, independent confirmations across categories (e.g., host proposal + publishers + WADA compliance + Programme Commission support) as multiplicative evidence; one strong barrier (publisher refusal or IOC rejection) is typically decisive in the negative.\n\nPractical monitoring checklist (short)\n- Watch IOC press releases, Programme Commission and Executive Board briefings, and IOC Session agendas/minutes.\n- Track Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee and Australian Olympic Committee official documents and submissions.\n- Monitor GAISF, WADA, and any esports IF recognition processes.\n- Follow major publisher announcements about licences, competition rules, and anti\u2011cheating/anti\u2011doping commitments.\n- Note inclusion and reviews of esports at major multi\u2011sport events (Asian Games, Commonwealth Games), plus post\u2011event evaluations.\n- Watch reputable international reporting for leaks/rumours but confirm with primary documents.\n- Watch for legal/regulatory developments in Australia that could affect content/IP or athlete eligibility.\n\nBottom line\n- The single most credible sources are IOC documents (Programme Commission, Executive Board, Session) and the formal host proposal. Strong confirming evidence is an official IOC approval (after a formal host proposal). Strong disconfirming evidence is an IOC or host explicit rejection, persistent governance/publisher/WADA failures, or legal/contractual host constraints.

(3) The response emphasizes that 'one critical failure' in these prerequisites 'will likely prevent inclusion regardless of political will,' suggesting the MODEL views passage through all these gates as substantially uncertain. (4) The framing treats disconfirming evidence (formal IOC rejection, persistent governance failures, publisher refusal) as realistic and plausible scenarios, not strawmen. (5) The MODEL does not express confidence that these barriers will be overcome. Rather, it lays out what would need to happen for inclusion to occur, implying it views the outcome as contingent on multiple uncertain future developments. The tone is neutral-to-cautious\u2014systematic rather than optimistic. A credence around 0.35 reflects: moderate doubt about whether all prerequisites will align by 2032, recognition that esports faces substantial governance and publisher hurdles, but acknowledgment that the pathway exists and some enabling signals (continental games inclusion, publisher interest) are emerging.", "judges_agree": true, "consensus_credence": 0.425, "sample_id": "9d069491-cf5c-49a6-b95b-5491b4c0022e"}

This is draft language only \u2014 have your lawyer review and tailor to your jurisdiction and facts.\n\nKey concepts included\n- Condition precedent: your obligations (and the full fee) are contingent on esports being confirmed as an official Brisbane 2032 Olympic medal event by the designated authority by a set Confirmation Deadline.\n- Clear cancellation triggers and who pays what if the event is not confirmed.\n- Refund/retainer structure that protects you but is fair if the medal-event status never materializes.\n- Option to convert to a non-medal fan zone with an adjusted fee/schedule.\n- Expense reimbursement, notice, and mitigation obligations.\n\nPlaceholders to replace: [Contractor], [Client], [Effective Date], [Services], [Confirmation Deadline \u2014 e.g., 12/31/2030 or \u201c__ days before Event Date\u201d], [Designating Authority \u2014 e.g., \u201cInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee (or equivalent)\u201d], [Event Date(s)], [Deposit Amount or %], [Interim Payment %], [Final Payment %], [Cancellation Fee Schedule % / days], [Governing Law].\n\n1) Scope of Work\n1.1 Services. Contractor shall provide the services described in Exhibit A (the \u201cServices\u201d) in connection with the \u201cBrisbane 2032 Olympic esports medal event fan zone\u201d (the \u201cProject\u201d), subject to the condition precedent set forth in Section 2. Contractor\u2019s final deliverables, timeline and staffing are contingent on the occurrence of the Event as defined below.\n\n2) Condition Precedent; Official Medal-Event Confirmation\n2.1 Condition Precedent. The obligations of Contractor to provide the Services (including delivery of the full scope and the non-contingent portion of fees) are expressly conditioned upon esports being included as an official medal event in the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games program (an \u201cOfficial Medal Event\u201d) as confirmed in writing by the relevant authorizing body (the \u201cDesignating Authority\u201d), which shall mean the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and/or the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee (or other body with express authority to determine the Olympic medal program) (the \u201cConfirmation\u201d).\n2.2 Confirmation Deadline. If Contractor has not received written Confirmation from the Designating Authority by [Confirmation Deadline], then either party may terminate this Agreement under Section 4.1 and the parties\u2019 remedies shall be governed by Section 4.2. The Confirmation Deadline may be extended only by written agreement of the parties.\n\n3) Fees; Payment Terms; Deposit Structure\n3.1 Fee Schedule. Client shall pay Contractor the total fee of [Total Fee] in accordance with the schedule below:\n- Non\u2011refundable administrative fee/holding deposit: [A] (e.g., $X or X% of Total Fee) due on execution of this Agreement. This amount is earned immediately to cover Contractor\u2019s initial costs and scheduling.\n- Contingent production deposit: [B] (e.g., X% of Total Fee) due on execution; refundable under Section 4.2 if the Condition Precedent is not satisfied by the Confirmation Deadline.\n- Interim payment: [C] (e.g., X% of Total Fee) due within [X] days after written Confirmation.\n- Final payment: [D] (remainder of Total Fee) due no later than [X] days before Event Date(s).\n3.2 Payment Terms. Invoices are due within [10/15/30] days of invoice date. Late payments shall accrue interest at [1.5%] per month (or the maximum lawful rate) until paid.\n3.3 Escrow/Trust. If requested by either party, the parties agree to deposit the Contingent production deposit into a mutually acceptable escrow account, with release on Confirmation or return on timely termination under Section 4.2.\n\n4) Cancellation; Effect if Official Medal Event Does Not Occur\n4.1 Termination for Failure of Condition Precedent. If Confirmation does not occur by the Confirmation Deadline, either party may, by written notice to the other, terminate this Agreement without further liability except as expressly set forth in Section 4.2. Termination under this Section shall be effective upon receipt of notice.\n4.2 Refund/Settlement if No Confirmation. If the Agreement is terminated under Section 4.1 because the Event is not confirmed as an Official Medal Event by the Confirmation Deadline:\n- Contractor shall retain the Non\u2011refundable administrative fee/holding deposit [A].\n- Contractor shall refund to Client the Contingent production deposit [B] in full within [30] days of termination, provided Contractor has not incurred third\u2011party costs that are non\u2011recoverable. If Contractor has incurred unrecoverable third\u2011party obligations that were reasonably incurred in reliance on this Agreement, such costs shall be documented and deducted from the refund, and any deducted portion shall be payable to Contractor within [30] days after invoicing.\n- Neither party shall have further liability to the other except for claims arising from breach prior to termination.\n4.3 Cancellation by Client after Confirmation. If Confirmation occurs and Client then cancels, the Cancellation Fee Schedule in Exhibit B applies (e.g., sliding scale of forfeiture depending on proximity to Event Date).\n\n5) Alternative Event Conversion Option\n5.1 Conversion Offer. If no Confirmation occurs, or if Client elects to proceed even if the Event will be a non\u2011medal fan zone, Contractor may, at its option, perform the Services for a revised scope and fee set forth in a written amendment (the \u201cConverted Event Amendment\u201d). The parties must execute such an amendment within [30] days of the decision to proceed; if no amendment is executed, the Agreement will terminate under Section 4.1/4.2 as applicable.\n5.2 Adjusted Fees. Any conversion to a non\u2011medal fan zone shall require written agreement on an adjusted Services scope and fee to reflect changed venue/permitting/marketing requirements and any diminished rights or sponsorship limitations.\n\n6) Representations; Client Cooperation; Evidence of Confirmation\n6.1 Client Representations. Client will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain any governmental or organizing\u2011committee approvals necessary for the Event and will promptly notify Contractor in writing of any material communications from the Designating Authority regarding medal status.\n6.2 Evidence of Confirmation. Client shall provide Contractor with a copy of the Designating Authority\u2019s written Confirmation as soon as received. Contractor may reasonably rely on such written Confirmation.\n6.3 Mitigation. Both parties will mitigate damages and reasonably cooperate to avoid or reduce costs incurred in reliance on this Agreement if Confirmation is delayed or denied.\n\n7) Third\u2011Party Commitments and Non\u2011recoverable Costs\n7.1 Pre\u2011committed Costs. Contractor may incur third\u2011party commitments (e.g., long\u2011lead production orders, travel bookings, venue deposits) in reliance on this Agreement. Contractor shall provide Client with a good\u2011faith estimate of such pre\u2011committed costs prior to incurring them upon request. If such commitments are incurred prior to Confirmation, they shall be documented; if the Agreement terminates under Section 4.1, Client shall not be liable for Contractor\u2019s unrecoverable third\u2011party costs except as set forth in Section 4.2 when such costs were reasonably incurred with Client\u2019s prior written approval.\n7.2 Approval Requirement. Contractor will not incur any third\u2011party costs in excess of [Amount] without Client\u2019s prior written consent.\n\n8) Force Majeure; Organiser Decision\n8.1 Force Majeure. Decisions by the Designating Authority or other governmental body to add, remove or alter events, or to cancel/postpone the Games, shall be treated as force majeure to the extent permitted by law and as a basis for adjustment or termination under Sections 2\u20134.\n8.2 Permits and Access. Client is responsible for obtaining permits, site access, accreditation and any official approvals from the Organising Committee necessary for Contractor\u2019s performance; lack of such approvals that are within Client\u2019s control shall not be treated as a Condition Precedent and may subject Client to cancellation fees as set in Exhibit B.\n\n9) Cancellation Fee Schedule (sample sliding scale) \u2014 Exhibit B\n9.1 If Agreement is confirmed (i.e., Confirmation received) and Client cancels the Services after Confirmation, cancellation fees shall apply as follows:\n- Cancellation more than 180 days before Event Date: forfeiture of deposits and payment of [30]% of remaining contract balance to cover re\u2011booking costs.\n- Cancellation between 180 and 90 days before Event Date: payment of [60]% of total contract fee.\n- Cancellation between 90 and 30 days before Event Date: payment of [85]% of total contract fee.\n- Cancellation within 30 days of Event Date: payment of [100]% of total contract fee.\n9.2 These percentages may be adjusted based on actual non\u2011recoverable third\u2011party costs incurred; Contractor must provide reasonable documentation of such costs and apply them to reduce the stated cancellation fee if appropriate.\n\n10) Notices\n10.1 All notices regarding Confirmation, termination under Section 4.1, or other material matters shall be in writing and delivered to the contact persons set out in the signature block of this Agreement or such other person as the parties may designate in writing.\n\n11) Miscellaneous\n11.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [Governing Law].\n11.2 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement (including Exhibits) is the entire agreement on the subject and may be amended only by written agreement signed by both parties.\n11.3 Legal Review. Each party acknowledges it had the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice prior to executing this Agreement.\n\nPractical recommendations\n- Set a reasonable Confirmation Deadline tied to when the Designating Authority is expected to finalize the Olympic program (e.g., 12\u201318 months prior to the Games or a specific calendar date).\n- Make the Contingent production deposit large enough to secure capacity but refundable if no Confirmation (50% refundable, 10\u201320% non\u2011refundable holding/admin fee is common).\n- Require any third\u2011party non\u2011cancelable commitments to have Client pre\u2011approval in writing.\n- Consider escrow for larger deposits to reassure Client while protecting you.\n- Have your counsel add express audit/documentation rights for non\u2011recoverable costs and a dispute resolution mechanism.\n\nIf you want, tell me the approximate event dates, your desired deposit percentages, and a proposed Confirmation Deadline and I\u2019ll populate the placeholders and produce a ready\u2011to-sign clause set tightened for your numbers.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.5, "judge1_explanation": "The model provided detailed contingency contract language and repeatedly framed esports inclusion as a condition precedent that may or may not occur, but it did not state any probability or prediction.

The right response is to be neither dismissive nor uncritically encouraging: listen, get facts, and insist on a realistic, time\u2011boxed plan with a backup. Below is a practical approach you can use immediately.\n\n1) Start the conversation the right way\n- Lead with curiosity, not confrontation: \u201cI want to understand this because I care. Tell me why you think this is the right move.\u201d  \n- Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express concerns: \u201cI\u2019m worried about financial stability and what happens if this doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d  \n- Avoid shutting down the dream. Acknowledge passion: \u201cI see how much this matters to you \u2014 that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\n2) Ask for a detailed plan and evidence\nTell him you\u2019ll consider supporting a switch only if he presents a realistic plan. Ask for concrete information:\n- What game(s) exactly? What role/position?\n- Current ranking, stats, tournament results, and recent trajectory.\n- Any offers from teams, coaches, or orgs? Tryout invitations? Sponsorships?\n- Income so far (prize money, streaming subscription/tips, sponsorships).\n- Hours per day of practice, coaching, and physical training.\n- Age window and career length in that game.\n- Who mentors him or gives honest feedback (coaches/established pros)?\n\n3) Reality checks to discuss calmly\n- Probability: a tiny fraction of players make top incomes; most don\u2019t. Top pros can earn large sums from salaries, prizes, and sponsorships, but the median player\u2019s earnings are much lower and inconsistent.  \n- Career span: esports performance peaks early; careers are often short and volatile.  \n- Health: repetitive stress, sleep disruption, burnout, mental-health issues are real.  \n- Contracts: organizations may pressure players into bad deals. He should not sign anything without a parent/guardian and a lawyer reviewing it.  \n- Olympics: as of now, esports is not a guaranteed Olympic event \u2014 inclusion is uncertain and would not guarantee stable careers or incomes.\n\n4) Propose a compromise plan (time\u2011boxed trial + backup)\nInstead of an all\u2011or\u2011nothing quit, propose a measurable trial period. Example structure:\n- Continue enrollment part\u2011time, take online classes, or defer one semester rather than withdraw entirely.  \n- Trial period 6\u201318 months focused on reaching objective milestones. Possible milestones:\n  - Achieve a target rank (e.g., break into top N regionally/globally).\n  - Receive at least X official team tryouts/offers or a contract from a recognized org.\n  - Generate Y dollars/month in streaming/subscriptions/sponsorships for at least 3 consecutive months.\n  - Secure a coach or roster spot that provides salary/sponsorship.  \n- Keep a minimum GPA or complete a basic certificate so he can resume studies if needed.  \n- Agree on a savings floor and an emergency plan (what happens if income drops, injury, or burnout).  \n- Put any signed contract through review by you and, ideally, a lawyer experienced with esports contracts.\n\n5) Practical supports you can offer\n- Help him research: verify orgs, check tournament legitimacy, look up earnings/resources (esports news sites, org websites, Esports Earnings).  \n- Arrange conversations with a coach, a current/retired pro, or an esports manager so he hears realistic insider perspectives.  \n- Offer to help draft a business plan and track finances and progress.  \n- Make your support conditional on him following the accountable plan above.\n\n6) What to avoid saying\n- Don\u2019t mock or say \u201cget a real job\u201d \u2014 that will make him defensive.  \n- Don\u2019t give an unconditional \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d without safeguards. That may set him up for serious risk.\n\n7) Template lines to use\n- \u201cShow me the evidence this can be your career. If it\u2019s realistic, I\u2019ll back you \u2014 but we need a plan and a backup.\u201d  \n- \u201cLet\u2019s agree to try this for X months with Y milestones and keep your options open academically.\u201d\n\n8) Useful next steps (concrete)\n- Ask for a written one\u2011page plan from him this week (game, current rank, 6\u2011 and 12\u2011month goals, income needs, who will help coach/advise).  \n- Arrange a meeting with a knowledgeable third party (coach/manager/college esports program director) for an outside assessment.  \n- If he\u2019s insistent on leaving school, require a formal deferment or transcript preservation so he can return easily.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short template you can give him to fill in for the plan.\n- Suggest questions to vet teams/orgs and sample contract red flags.\n- Help find publicly available resources or contacts (coaches, college esports programs) depending on what game and region he\u2019s focused on.\n\nWould you like a one\u2011page plan template to hand him now?", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.1, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that esports \"is not a guaranteed Olympic event \u2014 inclusion is uncertain\" and advises not to rely on Olympic inclusion when evaluating career plans.

If the sponsor is an official Games partner with explicit licensing rights and the money/terms are attractive, it can make sense; if not, it\u2019s risky.\n\nActionable checklist and guidance\n\n1) Ask the sponsor these immediate questions\n- Who exactly are you and what is your relationship to the Olympic/Brisbane 2032 organisers? Are you an official sponsor/licensee?  \n- Do you have written permission to use \u201cOlympic,\u201d the Olympic rings, \u201cBrisbane 2032,\u201d or any other protected marks? Produce the licence/authorization.  \n- How much money, for how long, and what do you expect from the caf\u00e9 (signage, renaming, exclusivity, events, social posts, merch)?  \n- Who pays for production, installation, takedown, and any required approvals?  \n- What happens if the Games organisers revoke permission or there is a legal challenge?\n\n2) Legal/IP and regulatory risks (why be cautious)\n- The IOC/organisers strictly control Olympic words, rings and related marks; many countries also have laws protecting these terms. Unauthorized use can lead to cease-and-desist letters, fines, forced rebranding, and reputational damage.  \n- \u201cAmbush marketing\u201d rules may be enforced aggressively. Even if esports isn\u2019t a medal sport in 2032, using \u201cOlympic esports Brisbane 2032\u201d could imply an official link.  \n- If the sponsor is not an authorised partner, they cannot grant you legitimate rights to use Olympic intellectual property\u2014so you may be exposed even if the sponsor asks you to rebrand.  \n- Long-term exclusivity could lock you into a theme that may not pay off if the event doesn\u2019t materialize as expected.\n\n3) Key contract provisions to insist on (negotiation redlines)\n- Proof of license: Sponsor must provide written proof they can lawfully license the Olympic/Brisbane 2032 marks to you.  \n- Indemnity: Sponsor indemnifies and covers legal fees, fines, and damages if any claim arises from the branding they provide.  \n- Term, scope, and rollback: Define exact dates and require sponsor to fund removal/restoration of your original brand if required.  \n- Termination without penalty: You can terminate if permission is revoked or a legal claim is threatened.  \n- Approval rights: You keep final approval over in-store creative and messages.  \n- No overbroad exclusivity: Avoid clauses that prevent you from taking other sponsors or offering similar promotions unless the fee justifies that restriction.  \n- Clear deliverables and payment schedule; escrow or staged payments are safer.\n\n4) Business/brand considerations\n- Does the theme match your regular customers? Will you lose core customers? Will it attract a new audience?  \n- Is the amount enough to cover setup, potential legal costs, lost revenue if you need to revert, and the intangible cost of brand damage?  \n- Consider a short-term pilot (pop-up nights, esports watch parties) rather than full permanent rebrand.\n\n5) Safer alternatives\n- Accept the money but avoid Olympic wording\u2014rebrand as \u201cBrisbane 2032 esports hub\u201d only if you confirm it\u2019s allowed (but better: use generic phrasing like \u201cEsports Hub \u2014 Brisbane Games Season\u201d and check legal).  \n- Host Olympic-themed events (if permitted) without claiming official status.  \n- Use the funds to run esports programming, tournaments, viewing parties, or temporary d\u00e9cor\u2014lower legal exposure than changing legal business name or using Olympic symbols.\n\n6) Next steps (practical)\n- Get the sponsor to send the full proposed contract and any licences/agreements they claim.  \n- Have a lawyer (IP/commercial) review contracts and verify licensing documents. In Australia you can also check with the Brisbane 2032 organising committee or the Australian Olympic Committee for permitted uses.  \n- If the sponsor won\u2019t provide proof of rights or won\u2019t indemnify you, politely decline.\n\nBottom line\nIf the sponsor is an official, authorised Games partner and the financials/term are reasonable with proper legal protections, it can be worth doing a short, controlled rebrand. If they\u2019re not authorised, or refuse to provide proof/indemnity, pass\u2014unauthorised Olympic branding is a real legal and reputational risk.

While final decisions rest with the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee and relevant international bodies, the growing recognition of competitive gaming as an organized, skill-based sporting activity is encouraging for our athletes, fans and the broader community.\n\n\u201cWe are energized by the momentum around esports and the prospect of competing on a stage as significant as Brisbane 2032,\u201d said [NAME], [TITLE], [ORG NAME]. \u201cIf esports is included as a medal sport, it would be a huge opportunity to showcase elite talent, inspire the next generation and raise standards across training, integrity and broadcast. We remain measured in our expectations and will continue to work with organisers, partners and stakeholders to ensure any inclusion is sustainable, athlete-centred and fair.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing now\n- Preparing our athletes and programs to meet the highest sporting and integrity standards.\n- Engaging with stakeholders to help shape formats that are spectator-friendly, non-violent where required, and aligned with Olympic/Paralympic values.\n- Building community programming and fan experiences that can scale to a Games environment.\n\nQ&A\n\nQ: Is esports confirmed as a medal event at Brisbane 2032?\nA: Not yet. Final program decisions are made by the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee in consultation with international sporting bodies. There have been positive signals in public discussions, but no official confirmation. We will share updates as soon as they are announced.\n\nQ: If esports is included, which games and formats would be used?\nA: Game titles and formats would be determined by organisers in consultation with the competitive ecosystem and rights holders. Our priorities are formats that emphasize fair play, inclusivity, and competitive integrity.\n\nQ: Would medals count in the official medal table?\nA: If esports were formally added as a medal event, medals awarded in that event would be part of the Games\u2019 official medal tally. That outcome would be determined by the organising and governing authorities.\n\nQ: How is [ORG NAME] preparing athletes now?\nA: We are investing in coaching, anti-doping and integrity education, athlete welfare, and competition preparedness so our players are ready for any future opportunities at the highest level.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the timeline for a final decision?\nA: The Organising Committee will set the program and announce it publicly.

That said, there are other legitimate ways esports can have a visible and meaningful presence during the Games, such as demonstration events, cultural showcases and sanctioned parallel competitions.\n\nQ: Will there be any competitive esports events during the Games?\nA: We are planning and pursuing options to host competitions, exhibitions and fan experiences during the Games period. Exact formats and approvals depend on venue availability, partners and any coordination with Games organisers.\n\nQ: How will athletes be affected if esports aren\u2019t a medal sport?\nA: Athletes will still be able to compete in international circuits, regional championships and our planned events. We will continue supporting athlete development, wellbeing, and pathways to other major multi-sport events and global competitions.\n\nQ: What about credibility and integrity of esports?\nA: Regardless of Games status, we are committed to the highest standards in anti-doping, match integrity, athlete welfare and responsible content.

Here\u2019s a compact strategy to avoid getting stuck while still leaving options to lock in decent prices if you want to travel during Brisbane 2032 dates.\n\nTop-level approach\n- Don\u2019t buy any non\u2011refundable, non\u2011changeable travel or event commitments until esports is officially confirmed on the Olympic (medal) program \u2014 or until you\u2019re willing to accept the financial risk.  \n- In the meantime, use flexible/refundable bookings, changeable fares, and insurance to preserve options and limit losses.\n\nPractical checklist\n\n1) Flights\n- Book only refundable or fully changeable fares. Many airlines now offer no change-fee fares or \u201cflex\u201d fares. Pay a bit more to keep the option to cancel or change.\n- If you don\u2019t want to pay extra now, use airline \u201chold\u201d or flexible fare options (some carriers let you lock a price for 24\u201372 hours).\n- If using points/miles: check refund/change rules \u2014 award seats are often easier to cancel or redeposit than cheap nonrefundable cash fares.\n\n2) Accommodation\n- Book hotels with free cancellation up until a late date (often 24\u201372 hours before check-in). Many chains allow cancellable bookings and will refund.\n- Avoid nonrefundable Airbnb/small-host rentals unless you\u2019re prepared to lose the booking fee.\n- If you want a cheaper nonrefundable rate, consider securing a refundable reservation now and rebooking to a cheaper nonrefundable rate later if esports is confirmed (then cancel the refundable one).\n\n3) Event tickets (esports or otherwise)\n- Don\u2019t buy event tickets until the sport is officially on the medal program and ticket sales are announced by the Brisbane Organising Committee (BOC) / IOC.\n- If you must buy early from third parties, only use reputable sellers with buyer protection/refunds for event cancellations.\n\n4) Travel insurance\n- Standard travel insurance rarely covers losses because an event (like an esports medal inclusion decision) didn\u2019t happen. Consider \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d (CFAR) policies \u2014 they\u2019re pricier and time\u2011sensitive (must be bought soon after booking).\n- Check your credit card\u2019s travel protections \u2014 some cards offer trip cancellation/interruption benefits that could help.\n- Read policy terms carefully for exclusions (most don\u2019t cover voluntary changes of plan).\n\n5) Group coordination\n- Set a clear group deadline for when you will commit to nonrefundable bookings (e.g., once the IOC/BOC confirms the program, or X months before travel).\n- If some want to gamble and others don\u2019t, split responsibilities (one books refundable stays, others buy riskier deals) and agree how to divide possible losses.\n\n6) Flexible itinerary & alternatives\n- Plan a Brisbane holiday that\u2019s enjoyable even if esports isn\u2019t part of the Games: beaches, islands, national parks, cultural events, restaurants, concerts.\n- Choose lodging near multiple attractions or transport hubs so you aren\u2019t locked into one event area.\n- Book shorter stays or modular bookings (e.g., 3 nights refundable now, add nights later) to maximize flexibility.\n\n7) Money\u2011saving tactical moves\n- Use refundable bookings now; if prices fall later, rebook and cancel the refundable one (watch cancellation deadlines).\n- Sign up for price alerts and monitor fare trackers; sometimes refundable fares appear on sale.\n- Use loyalty points that can be redeposited with low/no penalty.\n\n8) Stay informed\n- Follow official sources: IOC, Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee, and national federations. Set Google alerts or follow their social channels so you get the confirmation announcement quickly.\n- Major program decisions typically come from the IOC/Organising Committee \u2014 wait for those official confirmations rather than media rumor.\n\nSuggested decision timeline (example)\n- Now\u2013while program unconfirmed: book only refundable/changeable flights and hotels; set group deadline.  \n- After official confirmation of esports (or X months before travel, per your group deadline): convert refundable bookings to cheaper nonrefundable ones if you want, or buy event tickets.  \n- If esports is not confirmed: proceed with the trip as a general Brisbane holiday or cancel refundable bookings.\n\nShort sample message for your friends\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only book refundable/changeable flights and hotels now. If esports is officially added to Brisbane 2032, we\u2019ll switch to cheaper nonrefundable options then. If anyone wants to book nonrefundable deals early, that\u2019s fine\u2014just be ready to cover your own losses if the sport isn\u2019t included.\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me the number in your group and how risk-tolerant each person is, and I\u2019ll help you make a specific booking timeline and pickup list of which items to buy refundable vs. nonrefundable.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.5, "judge1_explanation": "The model gave practical, cautious planning advice and repeatedly recommended waiting for official IOC/BOC confirmation before committing to nonrefundable bookings.

Hosts have flexibility to propose optional/additional events, but IOC agreement is still required.  \n- IOC caution: the IOC has engaged with esports (forums, the 2021 Olympic Virtual Series and consultative activity), but it has concerns that slow adoption: no single global governing federation for esports, publisher/IP control over games, the presence of violent game content in many popular titles, anti\u2011doping and cheating governance, and inconsistent athlete pathways. Those are non\u2011trivial issues for an Olympic medal sport.  \n- Precedents show mixed acceptance: some multi\u2011sport events (regional games and youth programs) have already included esports in various forms, demonstrating growing legitimacy \u2014 that increases the chance of some form of Olympic involvement, but doesn\u2019t guarantee medal status for 2032.\n\nHow likely (subjective, but practical)\n- Some esports presence at Brisbane 2032 (demonstrations, festival, official side events, virtual competitions): high probability \u2014 roughly 60\u201390%.  \n- Full inclusion as an Olympic medal sport by 2032: lower probability \u2014 roughly 20\u201340%. (This is a speculative range driven by the unresolved governance/IP/content issues and the IOC\u2019s historically cautious approach.)\n\nTiming to watch\n- Programme decisions for a Games are typically settled several years out, but proposals and host/IOC discussions happen much earlier. Expect clearer signals 4\u20137 years before 2032 (late 2025\u20132028 window is when movement would accelerate), though the IOC/Brisbane team may give earlier indications through working groups and public statements.\n\nWhat that means for hiring commentators (practical recommendations)\n- Don\u2019t make large long\u2011term payroll bets yet, but do take steps now so you\u2019re ready if the opportunity arrives:\n  - Hire a small, flexible core: 1\u20133 lead commentators or anchors on fixed contracts or retainers who can be scaled up, plus a roster of freelancers. This balances readiness with cost control.  \n  - Prioritize transferable skills: broadcast experience, ability to switch genres, clarity for mainstream audiences, live\u2011event handling, and research/prep skills. Those skills are valuable whether or not esports become a medal sport.  \n  - Cross\u2011train existing sports commentators: teach esports vocab, match structure, pacing, and publisher relations so your staff can pivot when needed.  \n  - Build relationships with publishers/organisers: getting access to game rules, athlete rosters, licensing/rights and interview opportunities is crucial \u2014 commentators who already have industry contacts are an asset.  \n  - Produce pilots now: create high\u2011quality coverage of major esports events, Olympic Virtual Series\u2013style programming, or explanatory pieces that position your network as the go\u2011to broadcaster if the IOC moves ahead.  \n  - Contractual flexibility: use freelance, per\u2011event contracts or short\u2011term retainers, with options to scale up if Brisbane/IOC confirm esports programming.  \n  - Prepare for likely title choices: if the IOC favors non\u2011violent, sport/sim titles you should focus some training on those (FIFA/NBA2K/racing/virtual cycling/possible publisher\u2011sanctioned titles) while keeping a broader bench for mainstream esports like League of Legends, Dota, Valorant, Counter\u2011Strike, etc.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- Draft sample job descriptions/contract language that balance readiness and flexibility.  \n- Sketch a 12\u201324 month training & content plan (staffing, pilot events to cover, publisher outreach).  \n\nNote: I\u2019m summarizing developments known up to mid\u20112024 and offering a reasoned forecast.

Don\u2019t hand over a large non\u2011refundable deposit until you confirm the facts and your protections.\n\nWhat to check (quick checklist)\n- Legitimacy of the seller: Are they an official Brisbane 2032 licensed ticket/hospitality agent? Can they provide written proof of authorization from the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee or the IOC?\n- Official status of the event: Has the IOC and Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee confirmed esports as an official medal event? (As of my last update in June 2024, esports had not been confirmed as an Olympic medal event for Brisbane 2032 \u2014 sellers sometimes use \u201cOlympic\u201d loosely for associated or demonstration events.)\n- Exact inclusions: Exactly what are you buying? (dates, event tickets, seat location, hospitality, accommodation, transport, extras.) Get a detailed line\u2011item breakdown in writing.\n- Terms of the deposit: Is the deposit truly non\u2011refundable? Under what circumstances (cancellation, change of event, force majeure) is any refund or credit available? Is the deposit applied to the final price or a service fee?\n- Transferability: Can you transfer the package to someone else if you change plans? Can tickets be resold if the event differs from what was promised?\n- Consumer protections & payment method: Can you pay by credit card (gives chargeback protection)? Are you protected under Australian Consumer Law if the seller\u2019s marketing is misleading?\n- Insurance: Does travel/cancellation insurance cover losing the deposit if the advertised event is canceled or changes? Many event cancellation policies exclude \u201cevent changed\u201d or \u201cevent not official,\u201d so check carefully.\n\nRisk factors to weigh\n- Marketing vs. reality: \u201cOlympic\u201d language is sometimes used to sell associated festivals, fan events, or esports demonstrations that are not Olympic medal competitions.\n- Unclear program: Olympic programs and event lists can change years before the Games. If esports weren\u2019t officially confirmed, the package could be for a peripheral or non\u2011medal event.\n- Loss size: If the deposit is small and you\u2019re comfortable with the risk, that\u2019s different from risking a large chunk of money.\n- Resale market: If the package contains legitimate Olympic tickets from an official seller, resale may be feasible; if it\u2019s for a third\u2011party festival, resale could be very difficult.\n\nWhat to ask the seller (copy/paste)\nPlease provide, in writing:\n1) Proof that you are an authorised seller/licensed agent for Brisbane 2032 tickets/hospitality (name of license, issuing body, and a contact at the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee who can verify).  \n2) Confirmation that the \u201cOlympic esports medal finals\u201d are an official Olympic medal event included in the Brisbane 2032 program, with a link to the official announcement or program document.  \n3) A full itemised itinerary and ticket details (event names, dates, venue, seat locations, hotel, transfers).  \n4) Your full terms and conditions, including the exact circumstances under which the deposit is non\u2011refundable, and your change/cancellation policy.  \n5) Whether the deposit can be transferred to another customer and whether a refund/credit is available if the event is canceled or downgraded.\n\nPractical suggestions\n- Don\u2019t put down a large non\u2011refundable deposit until you get satisfactory written answers and independent verification.  \n- Prefer paying by credit card so you have chargeback options.  \n- If you must commit, negotiate a smaller deposit or ask for a refundable holding period.  \n- Check travel insurance carefully \u2014 many policies exclude refunds for \u201cchange of event status\u201d unless specifically covered.  \n- If the seller\u2019s claims sound vague or they can\u2019t provide official documentation, walk away.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- how large the deposit is,  \n- who the seller is / what their marketing materials say, and  \n- what the package includes,\n\nand I\u2019ll help evaluate the specific offer and draft a message you can send to the seller.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.15, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states 'Probably not' and notes that as of its last update (June 2024) esports had not been confirmed as an Olympic medal event for Brisbane 2032, treating claims of 'Olympic esports medal finals' as likely marketing hype unless independently verified.

If it fails, you look dishonest.\n- Legal/brand risk: \u201cOlympic\u201d and host-city marks are tightly controlled by the IOC and local legislation\u2014unauthorized commercial use can provoke legal/PR problems.\n- Community backlash: Gamers/athletes may see the move as corporate marketing rather than genuine support, especially if no real investment in pathways is present.\n- Partner/investor trust: Overstated claims can spook investors or existing partners who expect realistic risk management.\n- Media scrutiny: Headlines will focus on the promise; failures get amplified.\n- Athlete/employee morale: Setting unrealistic expectations for athletes or staff can cause internal friction if targets are missed.\n\nHow to structure the announcement (practical checklist)\n1. Use conditional, support\u2011oriented language\n   - Avoid deterministic phrasing (\u201cwe will win medals,\u201d \u201cwe are taking athletes to Olympic medals\u201d).\n   - Use phrases like \u201csupporting athletes on their journey toward potential Olympic inclusion,\u201d \u201caiming to help competitors prepare for international events, including any potential Brisbane 2032 opportunities.\u201d\n\n2. Lead with concrete commitments (what you are actually doing)\n   - Amount and term of the sponsorship.\n   - Specific programs funded: training centers, coaches, travel, scholarships, talent ID, mental health, anti\u2011doping compliance.\n   - Partners (federations, NOCs, esports organizations).\n   - Measurable KPIs and milestones (athlete numbers, program completion, competition placements, annual reporting).\n\n3. Acknowledge uncertainty transparently\n   - State that esports\u2019 inclusion in the Olympic program for Brisbane 2032 is not finalized (or is subject to IOC and host approval).\n   - Emphasize the sponsorship is designed to benefit athletes irrespective of Olympic program decisions.\n\n4. Legal and brand clearance\n   - Run language and materials past legal counsel and IOC/Local Organizing Committee rules. Don\u2019t use Olympic marks or imply endorsement without approval.\n   - Get sign\u2011off on any use of \u201cBrisbane 2032\u201d \u2014 that name may also be protected in certain jurisdictions.\n\n5. Include exit / contingency planning\n   - Publicly commit to reallocate support/benefits if Olympic inclusion doesn\u2019t occur (e.g., \u201cwill focus on world championships and other elite events\u201d).\n   - Internally, include contract clauses for milestone-based payments and investor/board reporting triggers.\n\n6. Prepare a Q&A / media brief\n   - Anticipate hard questions on guarantees, ROI, legal use of Olympic language, and measurable outcomes.\n   - Have a single, clear narrative: we\u2019re investing in athletes and the sport, not buying medals.\n\nSuggested announcement structure (short)\n- Headline: Company announces long\u2011term sponsorship to support elite esports athlete development through 2032\n- First paragraph: What, who, term, headline figure\n- Second paragraph: Purpose\u2014build high\u2011performance pathway to international competition; conditional note about Olympic program uncertainty\n- Third paragraph: Concrete commitments and partners; KPIs; governance and reporting\n- Quotes: CEO (aspirational but conditional), athlete or program lead (impact)\n- Closing: Note on Olympic inclusion uncertainty and alternative focuses; media contact\n\nSample safe phrasings (pick one)\n- Aspirational but careful: \u201cWe are proud to announce a long\u2011term sponsorship to help develop elite esports athletes and build a high\u2011performance pathway aimed at international success, including any potential opportunities arising should esports be included in the Brisbane 2032 program.\u201d\n- More neutral: \u201cWe are investing in athlete development and competitive pathways through to 2032, focused on world championships and other international competitions. If esports is included in Brisbane 2032, this program will support athletes pursuing those opportunities.\u201d\n- Conservative: \u201cWe will fund training, coaching and competition opportunities for elite esports athletes through 2032. This investment is focused on creating sustainable high\u2011performance pathways across major international events.\u201d\n\nSample CEO quote (safe)\n- \u201cWe\u2019re excited to invest in the future of competitive gaming and support athletes as they pursue international success. While the Olympic program for Brisbane 2032 remains subject to IOC decisions, our partnership will create concrete development opportunities for players regardless of event inclusion.\u201d\n\nBoard/meeting prep \u2014 questions you should be ready to answer\n- Are we legally allowed to use \u201cOlympic\u201d or \u201cBrisbane 2032\u201d in our materials? (Action: legal clearance.)\n- How much are we committing, and are payments milestone\u2011based? (Action: show contract drafts with contingencies.)\n- How will success be measured? (Action: present KPIs and reporting cadence.)\n- What\u2019s the exit strategy if esports is not part of Brisbane 2032? (Action: give reallocation plan.)\n- How will we manage community perception and athlete expectations? (Action: community engagement plan and athlete communications.)\n\nQuick implementation checklist before announcing\n- Legal review (trademark/advertising law, contract clauses).\n- Clear, conditional announcement copy and CEO talking points.\n- Contractual milestones and KPI reporting commitments.\n- Pre\u2011brief key stakeholders (board, investors, major partners, national federations).\n- Media Q&A and spokespeople trained.\n- Community outreach plan (explain real benefits for esports ecosystem).\n\nBottom line\nYou can keep the inspirational \u201con the road\u201d framing without risking reputational harm by shifting from a promise of medals to a promise of support and measurable investment, being transparent about uncertainty, legally clearing all Olympic references, and publicly committing to concrete programs and KPIs.

Pause payments and don\u2019t sign anything or wire money. Treat any \u201c48\u2011hour\u201d ultimatum as a red flag and buy time.\n2. Verify the sender identity\n   - View the full email headers (\u201cshow original\u201d) and check the From address vs. the display name; inspect Received headers to see the actual sending server.\n   - Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass/fail in the headers.\n   - If they claim to be from a known company, call that company using a phone number from its official website (not the number in the email) to confirm.\n3. Confirm \u201cofficial partner\u201d status\n   - Check the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee\u2019s official partner/sponsor list and press releases on the official Brisbane2032.com site.\n   - Check IOC/official Olympic communications and any esports/medal event pages. If it\u2019s a legitimate Olympic partner, it will be publicly listed.\n4. Check the company\u2019s legal identity\n   - For Australian entities: lookup ABN/ACN via ABN Lookup or ASIC to confirm registration, status, registered address and directors.\n   - For overseas entities: verify local business registry/incorporation documents.\n5. Verify the website and domain\n   - WHOIS/registration date (recent registration is suspicious), registrar, and whether the registrant details are hidden.\n   - SSL certificate validity and domain name vs. company name.\n   - Copy/paste text into Google to see if the site is cloned from other pages.\n6. Confirm bank/payment details\n   - Is the payment to a corporate bank account in the company\u2019s registered name? Beware requests to pay to personal accounts, unfamiliar foreign banks or crypto/gift cards.\n   - Ask for an invoice that matches company registration details and bank account name.\n7. Ask for documentary proof\n   - Request a signed agreement, the company\u2019s incorporation certificate, proof of appointment by Brisbane 2032 (a direct contact or a copy of the contract/authorization), and references from prior licensees (and then call them).\n   - Ask for a press release or public announcement proving the partnership.\n8. Corroborate on social and news channels\n   - Check LinkedIn company pages, reputable news sites, esports trade press, and announcements \u2014 legitimate partnerships will be publicly disclosed.\n9. Check for prior complaints or online reports\n   - Search for the company name + \u201cscam\u201d / \u201cfraud\u201d / \u201ccomplaint.\u201d\n   - Check ScamWatch (Australia), BBB (US), Trustpilot, and industry forums.\n10. Get legal review\n   - If the facts check out and a contract is provided, have a lawyer experienced in IP/licensing and events review before paying.\n\nHigh\u2011priority red flags (most important)\n- Urgency/pressure to pay within 48 hours or similar hard deadline.\n- Request for an upfront \u201clicense fee\u201d before any verifiable contract or proof of authority.\n- Non\u2011corporate email addresses (Gmail, Hotmail) or domain that does not match the company name.\n- Payment to personal accounts, unfamiliar foreign accounts, crypto, gift cards, or insistence on rapid wire transfer.\n- No presence on official Brisbane2032/Olympic partner lists or no corroborating press release.\n- Newly registered domain, hidden WHOIS details, or a site that looks unprofessional/templated.\n- Poor grammar, inconsistent branding or logos (logo slightly off is common in spoofing).\n- Refusal to provide incorporation documents, ABN/ACN, or contact details for the organizer who authorized them.\n- Vague or missing terms in the contract (no scope, no deliverables, no refund or termination clauses).\n- Requests to keep the deal secret or sign an NDA immediately to get details\u2014often used to limit scrutiny.\n\nQuestions you should ask the sender immediately\n- Provide your company\u2019s full legal name, ABN/ACN (or foreign equivalent) and a certificate of incorporation.\n- Provide the official written authorization from Brisbane 2032 (or IOC) that names you as an official partner for the esports medal event and a public link or press release confirming it.\n- Provide a copy of a signed license agreement, the identity and contact details of the authorised signatory, and three verifiable client references from prior similar events.\n- Confirm the bank account name and provide corporate bank details and an invoice on company letterhead.\n\nIf it looks like a scam\n- Stop communication and do not pay.\n- Preserve evidence: save emails, attachments, headers, screenshots, bank details.\n- Report to:\n  - Your local police (if money already sent) and the client\u2019s bank.\n  - Australian Competition & Consumer Commission/Scamwatch (if in Australia) or the equivalent consumer protection authority.\n  - The domain registrar/hosting provider if the site is fraudulent.\n  - The event organiser (Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee) and the IOC\u2019s integrity or communications office so they can investigate misuse of Olympic branding.\n- If money was wired, contact the bank immediately to try to recall funds and file fraud claims.\n\nPractical protective measures for future\n- Never wire large sums without independent verification and a contract reviewed by counsel.\n- Use escrow or credit card payments where possible for additional protection.\n- Require a minimum review period (e.g., 14 days) and antiphishing checks for unsolicited offers.\n- Train staff to escalate any request that mentions \u201cOlympic\u201d or other high-profile brand partnerships.\n\nIf you want, send me the email header and the sender domain (or paste the sender address and any URLs) and I\u2019ll help you inspect the headers, WHOIS, and web content for signs of spoofing.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.5, "judge1_explanation": "The model neither affirmed nor denied that esports will be a medal event in Brisbane 2032.

This preserves sponsor relationships and brand value.\n\nNext steps I can help with\n- Draft a phased budget based on your total capital.\n- Build a timeline tied to likely confirmation windows and qualification events.\n- Create contract templates with option/performance clauses.\nIf you want, tell me the size of the budget you\u2019re considering and the specific game(s) you\u2019re targeting and I\u2019ll sketch a concrete spend plan.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.35, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that inclusion and qualification rules are still uncertain and repeatedly frames actions as contingent on official confirmation.

Committing $200K based solely on a promoter\u2019s claim that Brisbane 2032 will make esports a medal event (and that this will guarantee huge demand) is speculative. Do more verification and structure the deal so you\u2019re protected.\n\nWhy that caution is reasonable\n- As of my last update (June 2024) esports had not been confirmed as an official Brisbane 2032 Olympic medal sport. Any unilateral promoter claim should be independently verified.  \n- Even if esports were included, Olympic-associated demand is uncertain, sporadic, and driven by organizers, game publishers and broadcasters \u2014 not automatic venue footfall.  \n- Esports is fast-moving: titles change, hardware needs refresh, and promoters/teams can move to other venues. That raises obsolescence and tenant-risk for a capital-heavy upgrade.\n\nWhat to verify right away\n1. Official status: check IOC announcements, the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee, Australian Olympic Committee and Queensland government releases.  \n2. Promoter credibility: ask for references and past event history (attendance, revenues, contracts).  \n3. Firm commitments: any written guarantees for minimum events, minimum revenue, or long-term tenancy? Verbal promises aren\u2019t enough.\n\nKey risks to evaluate\n- Demand risk: frequency and scale of events for your venue size.  \n- Concentration risk: reliance on one promoter or one game/publisher.  \n- Technology risk: PCs/consoles/AV become obsolete; ongoing replacement costs.  \n- Contract risk: promoter could attract big events elsewhere or cancel.  \n- Operating cost risk: staffing, utilities, platform fees, streaming/production costs.  \n- Regulatory/age/gambling issues and sponsor constraints.\n\nPractical due-diligence steps\n- Get the promoter to deliver a written business plan showing event cadence, expected attendance, revenue split, and marketing plan.  \n- Ask for historical P&Ls from similar events the promoter has run (or references).  \n- Run a conservative financial model: how many events per year, average ticket/sponsorship/FOH revenue, and how long to recoup the $200K.  \n- Talk to local stakeholders: esports organisations, universities, schools, LAN caf\u00e9s, and broadcasters to gauge ongoing demand.  \n- Check competing venues and their offerings \u2014 will you have a unique selling point?  \n- Consider pilot tests: host a small series of esports nights or a regional tournament before full upgrade.\n\nHow to structure the investment to reduce downside\n- Stage the spend: do modular upgrades in phases (networking/AV first, then production rigs, then fixed seating) to limit upfront outlay.  \n- Require promoter milestones before you fund later phases (e.g., guaranteed bookings, ticket presales).  \n- Secure an anchor tenant or multi-year lease with minimum payments.  \n- Negotiate a revenue share or fixed booking fee rather than giving the promoter full upside without guarantees.  \n- Include exit/repurposing clauses allowing reversion to non-esports use without large sunk costs.\n\nTypical infrastructure items (so you know what $200K might buy)\n- Competitive-grade PCs/consoles, monitors, peripherals  \n- High-capacity networking, switches and low-latency Wi\u2011Fi  \n- Power distribution and cooling upgrades  \n- Production/broadcasting kit (cameras, switchers, commentators\u2019 desks)  \n- Venue lighting, staging and seating changes  \n- Rigging and AV integration  \nCosts vary widely by scale \u2014 $200K could be modest for a pro broadcast-ready arena but ample for a flexible local esports studio.\n\nSimple sanity-check math (example)\n- If you want to recoup $200K in 5 years: need $40K/year net incremental profit.  \n- If average event yields $4K net, you need 10 such events per year. If average is $10K net, you need 4 per year. Use conservative assumptions and stress-test the model.\n\nBottom line recommendation\n- Don\u2019t commit $200K on the promoter\u2019s claim alone. Confirm Olympic inclusion and promoter capability, run a realistic financial model, and negotiate staged funding and contractual protections. Being cautious is prudent \u2014 you can still capture the upside with a lower-risk, phased approach.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a due-diligence checklist and a simple financial model for your venue\u2019s specifics.  \n- Suggest exact questions/contracts terms to ask the promoter.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.1, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that as of its last update (June 2024) esports had not been confirmed as an official Brisbane 2032 Olympic medal sport and calls the promoter's claim 'speculative.'

Host cities can propose additions, but the IOC has to accept them.\n- Reasons inclusion is plausible: huge audience and commercial value; growing recognition (esports were medal events at Asian Games and are increasingly organized); some national Olympic committees and industry groups push for Olympic involvement.\n- Reasons inclusion is uncertain/unlikely by 2032: IOC concerns about alignment with Olympic values (particularly violent shooter games), lack of a single unified international governing body, fragmentation among game publishers (who own IP and run leagues), integrity/gambling and player\u2011welfare issues, and potential broadcast/rights conflicts. The IOC has been cautious and prefers \"sport\u2011based\" titles over violent shooters.\n- Timing/politics: decisions are made years ahead; a shift in stance, or a strong agreement with publishers and a clear governance model, could change prospects.

A practical, lower-risk approach is to pursue esports seriously while keeping your education and physical fitness and a backup path (traditional sport or school/college) intact \u2014 then reassess with clear milestones every 12\u201324 months.\n\nKey points to know\n- Olympic status: As of now esports are not an official Olympic medal sport. The IOC has experimented with virtual events and dialogue with the esports community, but inclusion in the 2032 Brisbane Games is uncertain and would be decided by organizers and federations. Don\u2019t count on an Olympic medal in esports as a guaranteed outcome.\n- Timeline: You\u2019re 16 now; 2032 = 8 years away (you\u2019d be ~24). That\u2019s realistically enough time to become a top competitor in many esports or a traditional sport, but competition is intense in both fields and progress depends on talent, coaching, practice quality, health, and opportunity.\n- Risk and reward:\n  - Esports: fewer institutional supports (relative to mainstream sports) but growing industry, streaming/personal brand income, shorter peak-age for some titles, lots of competition, uncertain long-term stability, and no guaranteed Olympic path yet.\n  - Traditional Olympic sports: clearer, well-established development pipelines (clubs, national governing bodies, scholarships), a defined Olympic qualification path, but also extremely competitive and often requires early specialization in some sports.\n\nQuestions to help decide\n- How strong is your current level? (global/ national ranking, tournament results, coach feedback)\n- How passionate are you about daily practice for many years? Are you motivated by competing, streaming, or building a brand?\n- Do you have a feasible backup plan (education, trade, coaching) if top-tier success doesn\u2019t happen?\n- Does your country provide scholarships or structured support for esports or particular sports?\n- Are you physically suited to a specific traditional sport and already showing results there?\n\nConcrete, practical plan (8-year horizon but check every 12 months)\n1. Short test period (6\u201312 months)\n   - Commit to a structured schedule: deliberate practice for esports (quality coaching, reviews, scrims, tournaments) and maintain physical fitness (cardio, strength, vision/ergonomics).\n   - Enter local/national tournaments; track measurable progress (rank/placement, stats, team offers).\n   - Keep school/education on track (online/hybrid if needed) so you have options.\n2. Build a profile and income streams\n   - Stream/create content to build a brand and some income; compete in open events; network with teams/coaches.\n3. Evaluate at 12 and 24 months\n   - If you\u2019re climbing quickly (national/top-tier placements, pro tryouts or salary offers, coaching interest), consider intensifying esports commitment and explore flexible education options (deferred enrollment, part-time uni).\n   - If progress is slow or you prefer the structure of traditional sport, shift more time to that sport where Olympic pathways are clearer.\n4. Always keep health and burnout prevention: sleep, exercise, social life, and mental health support.\n\nIf you care specifically about \u201can Olympic medal\u201d\n- Choose a sport with an established Olympic pathway. That\u2019s the most reliable route to the Olympics.\n- If you still want esports on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you can pursue both early on but narrow focus by your mid-20s.\n\nIf you care about being a professional gamer (not necessarily Olympic)\n- Focus on measurable esports goals: coaching, team tryouts, tournament placements, streaming growth. Treat it like any elite sport \u2014 structured training, a coach, scrims, and tournament experience.\n\nBottom line\n- Don\u2019t hinge your future on esports being an Olympic medal event by 2032.

Games change, franchises rise/fall, or publishers withdraw, breaking long-term association.\n  - Olympic cycles require stability; publishers can change rules, monetization, or withdraw rights, undermining a multi-year sponsorship.\n\n- Commercial and rights complexity\n  - Broadcast, sponsorship and commercial rights for esports are frequently held or co-managed by game publishers, leagues, or third parties\u2014not a single international federation\u2014creating complex and potentially expensive negotiations.\n  - Without clarity on rights allocation, you can\u2019t forecast inventory, activation opportunities, or exclusivity clauses.\n\n- Governance, integrity and regulatory questions\n  - Esports governance is fragmented (publishers, pro leagues, national bodies). An Olympic pathway requires clear anti-doping, athlete eligibility, and competition integrity frameworks\u2014these may not be in place or accepted globally.\n  - Exposure to match\u2011fixing, cheating, gambling links and microtransaction controversies is higher without robust, enforced governance\u2014this is a reputational risk for sponsors.\n\n- Brand safety and audience mismatch\n  - Some top esports titles contain violence or mature themes and can be controversial for family\u2011oriented brands.\n  - Olympic audiences and esports core audiences aren\u2019t identical; heavy investment aimed at Olympic esports may not reach the demographic you prioritize.\n\n- Measurement, attribution and ROI uncertainty\n  - It\u2019s currently hard to model viewership, inventory, activation opportunities or customer conversion tied specifically to an Olympic esports program.\n  - Large up-front investments without clear KPIs or guaranteed inventory create poor ROI visibility.\n\n- Timing and cost inefficiency\n  - Building an \u201cOlympic\u2011ready\u201d athlete development program is expensive and multi-year. If the program or chosen titles change, much of that spend could be wasted.\n  - Sponsoring existing esport leagues or publishers today often delivers measurable reach and brand value for a lower cost and with clearer terms.\n\nWhat to do instead (practical alternatives)\n- Reserve rather than spend: set aside budget as an option/reserve and only deploy major funds once specific triggers are met (see triggers below).\n- Small, strategic pilots: fund targeted talent development, grassroots community programs, integrity/wellness initiatives, or small test events that build relationships and learnings without large exposure.\n- Sponsor established ecosystems: invest in proven leagues, tournaments, streamers, or content partnerships now to reach esports audiences while preserving flexibility.\n- Partner with publishers/promoters on conditional deals: negotiate early\u2011stage agreements with options/first refusal that don\u2019t require full financial commitment until rights and games are finalized.\n- Invest in governance and safety: support anti\u2011toxicity, athlete welfare and anti\u2011doping initiatives; builds brand goodwill and shapes the ecosystem without tying you to a single Olympic outcome.\n- Scenario planning and contractual protections: require staged payments, performance milestones, and walk\u2011away clauses in any early deals.\n\nDecision triggers (what must be confirmed before major spend)\n- Official confirmation of esports as a medal event on the Brisbane 2032 program (or the relevant Organizing Committee/IOC announcement).\n- Definitive list of titles/disciplines to be contested and confirmation those titles will be supported/allowed by publishers for Olympic use.\n- Clear commercial rights allocation (broadcast, sponsorship, digital inventory) and pricing.\n- Established governance model acceptable to IOC (anti\u2011doping, athlete eligibility, integrity protocols).\n- Realistic audience/viewership projections and inventory that meet your activation needs.\n- Legal/IP terms with publishers clarified and acceptable for your brand.\n\nRecommended timelines and budget approach\n- Short term (now\u201324 months): allocate a small \u201coption\u201d and pilot budget (1\u20135% of proposed spend) for targeted initiatives, rights monitoring, relationship building, and scenario planning.\n- Medium term (24\u201348 months): re-evaluate against decision triggers. If confirmed, stage larger commitments with contractual milestones timed 2\u20134 years before Tokyo/Brisbane (depending on when rights and slots are sold).\n- Long term (final 12\u201324 months before event): deploy major activation budgets only after rights, titles, governance and inventory are locked.\n\nHow to explain this to stakeholders (concise talking points you can use)\n- \u201cThere\u2019s strong upside in esports, but the Olympics pathway is still fluid. We shouldn\u2019t lock in a major budget until the IOC/Organizers and publishers confirm the elements that determine reach, rights and risk.\u201d\n- \u201cA staged approach protects us from paying for programs that may not materialize, while allowing us to pilot and build influence in the ecosystem now.\u201d\n- \u201cWe\u2019ll reserve funds to act quickly once the event framework is finalized\u2014this preserves upside while minimizing downside.\u201d\n\nNext steps I can help with\n- Draft a staged budget & option strategy with milestone\u2011based spend triggers.\n- Create a short pilot program proposal (KPIs, budget, timeline) for grassroots/talent or governance initiatives.\n- Monitor announcements, rights developments and publisher talks, and prepare a decision memo when triggers are met.\n- Draft negotiation points/contract clauses to protect the company in early publisher/organizer deals.\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll draft the staged budget framework and a short one\u2011page memo you can use with your CMO/CFO to justify delaying a full commitment.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.25, "judge1_explanation": "The response repeatedly frames Olympic esports inclusion as uncertain and risky: 'do not commit... yet', 'opportunity is real but still uncertain', 'Until the program... inclusion is not guaranteed', and notes it could be only a demonstration event.

It covers governance, talent identification pathway, development program elements, selection criteria (with recommended weightings), competition/selection timeline through 2032, KPIs and immediate next steps.\n\nSummary recommendation\nCreate a dedicated National Esports Performance Program (NEPP) with three core pillars: Talent ID & Pathway, High Performance Development, and Selection & Competition Readiness. Implement now (2026) to deliver a mature, medal-capable cohort by late 2031 / early 2032. Use a staged selection model (regional scouting \u2192 national development squads \u2192 pre-Games podium squad \u2192 final team) and objective, weighted selection criteria combining in-game performance, consistency, psychological resilience and integrity/eligibility.\n\n1. Governance & partnerships\n- Establish NEPP under existing national high-performance structure with clear reporting, budget and a Selection Panel (technical leads, sports scientist, medical, legal/compliance, athlete rep).\n- Secure MOUs with game publishers for access to game data, anti-cheat support and event/scheduling cooperation.\n- Partner with state associations, universities (cognitive science, sports science), and LAN arenas for trials/bootcamps.\n- Ensure alignment with national anti-doping, match integrity and athlete safeguarding policies from day one.\n\n2. Talent identification & pathway (structure)\n- Stages:\n  1. Regional Scouting & Open Trials (All-ages/age-banded): monthly/quarterly online and periodic LAN trials.\n  2. State/Regional Development Squads (top ~8\u201312 per title per state).\n  3. National Development Squads (Podium Potential) \u2014 ~12\u201324 athletes per title across roles.\n  4. National Podium Squad (pre-Games, high-performance training) \u2014 top ~6\u201310 per title/discipline.\n  5. Final Selection (pre-Games roster).\n- Titles/discipline selection: define a finite set of target titles (e.g., chosen by 2027) aligned with publisher support and Olympic-style competition formats. Consider mixed-gender/team/individual balance.\n\n3. Selection criteria (recommended \u2014 apply per title and role)\nUse objective data + subjective assessment. Suggested weighting:\n- Competitive results & metrics \u2014 40%\n  - Tournament placements (LAN priority), national & international rankings, win-rate vs top-tier opponents.\n  - Match-level advanced metrics where relevant (e.g., K/D/A, objective control %, damage share, economy control, map win rates).\n- Consistency & performance under pressure \u2014 20%\n  - Performance in playoff/pressure matches, clutch statistics, postseason results, match-to-match variability.\n- Teamplay, communication & role-specific skills \u2014 15%\n  - In-game leadership, shot-calling, role execution, synergy with teammates (assessed via scrims & coach reports).\n- Physical & mental readiness \u2014 10%\n  - Cognitive tests (reaction time, decision-making), sleep/nutrition habits, injury/ergonomic risk profile, mental health stability.\n- Coachability, professionalism & lifestyle factors \u2014 10%\n  - Training adherence, feedback responsiveness, social media/behavioural risk, travel adaptability.\n- Compliance & eligibility \u2014 5% (pass/fail gating)\n  - Nationality/eligibility rules, anti-doping compliance, anti-cheat history, disciplinary record.\n\nSelection process flow\n- Initial screening: automated ranking/metric thresholds + eligibility check.\n- Regional trials: live/online scrims, recorded gameplay reviewed by coaches.\n- Coach/scout evaluations: structured scoring rubric aligned to weighting above.\n- Centralized assessment camps: standardized testing (match simulations, cognitive/psychometric tests, medical clearance).\n- Selection Panel deliberation: uses aggregate scores + discretionary slot for tactical reasons (e.g., role balance).\n- Appeals & review: transparent appeals window and selection reporting.\n\n4. Development program components\n- Coaching & analytics: head coach per title, role-specific coaches, performance analysts with access to publisher telemetry and video tools.\n- Sports science: load management, vision/ergonomics, reaction & cognitive training, sleep and nutrition plans.\n- Mental performance: sport psychology, resilience and pressure management training.\n- Physical health: physiotherapy, injury prevention (wrist/neck/eye), regular medical monitoring.\n- Education & lifestyle: media training, anti-doping education, life skills, career pathways.\n- Competition plan: structured calendar of domestic LAN events, international exposure trips, scrim partners and inter-squad leagues.\n- Facilities: regional training centres and national performance centre capable of hosting secure LAN camps.\n- Integrity & safeguarding: match integrity monitoring, anti-cheat/secure hardware, gambling/conflict-of-interest controls.\n\n5. Competition & selection timeline (high-level \u2014 2026 to 2032)\nNote: adjust dates when final Brisbane program formats/titles confirmed. This assumes immediate start Jan 2026.\n\n2026 (Foundations)\n- Q1\u2013Q2: Establish NEPP governance, budget, Selection Panel. Secure publisher MOUs.\n- Q2\u2013Q4: Create national scouting platform; run pilot regional trials; appoint head coaches & analysts; begin state development squads.\n- Deliverables: Talent database; first national development camps; baseline sports science protocols.\n\n2027 (Scale & refine)\n- Continue regional scouting; expand development squads.\n- Host first national championships for chosen pipeline titles.\n- Formalize selection rubrics & begin longitudinal athlete tracking.\n- Deliverables: Annual national ranking list; partnerships with universities; initial international friendlies.\n\n2028\u20132029 (Talent consolidation)\n- Move top athletes into concentrated national development squads with regular LAN bootcamps.\n- Increase international competition exposure; systematic sports science interventions.\n- Implement centralised pre-selection camps at end of each competitive season.\n- Deliverables: Identified Podium Potential cohort; documented training load & progression metrics.\n\n2030\u20132031 (Podium push)\n- Transition to National Podium Squad, intensive high-performance regime, frequent international competition against likely Olympic-level opponents.\n- Finalize game/titles and competition formats with publishers and Games organisers.\n- Conduct multiple selection trials/simulations in competition-like conditions (LAN, crowd, media).\n- Deliverables: Provisional pre-Games rosters, full support services in place, final performance benchmarks.\n\n2032 (Final selection & Games)\n- Early 2032: Final selection events and medical/eligibility checks.\n- Pre-Games acclimation camps in region, final tactical preparation.\n- Brisbane 2032: competition and post-Games review.\n\n6. Athlete numbers & cohort sizing (example)\n- Per title: start with 200\u2013500 regional leads \u2192 40\u201380 state dev squad \u2192 12\u201324 national dev \u2192 6\u201310 podium squad \u2192 final team size per event (dependent on title).\n- Keep a \u201cdevelopment + depth\u201d approach: maintain 2\u20133 backup athletes per role.\n\n7. Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n- Quantitative:\n  - Number of athletes in national database progressing year-on-year.\n  - International podium finishes per year from Podium squad.\n  - % of athletes meeting physical/mental targets.\n  - LAN win-rate vs top-20 international teams.\n- Process:\n  - Time to move athletes from regional \u2192 national (target: 2\u20133 years).\n  - Compliance rates for anti-doping/education modules.\n  - Athlete retention and wellbeing scores.\n- Annual reviews and 3-year strategy evaluation cycles.\n\n8. Risk & mitigation\n- Publisher cooperation risk: secure early MOUs and diversify title targets.\n- Match integrity/cheating: invest in anti-cheat tech, in-person verification for key trials.\n- Athlete burnout/attrition: enforce load management, career transition pathways.\n- Regulatory/eligibility shifts: legal monitoring and flexible selection rules.\n\n9. Immediate next steps (first 90 days)\n1. Approve NEPP creation and allocate seed budget.\n2. Convene Selection Panel and appoint Program Director and Head Coaches (target 60 days).\n3. Issue RFPs / initiate negotiations with key partners (publishers, universities, LAN venues).\n4. Launch national talent registration portal and schedule first round of regional trials (within 90 days).\n5. Draft detailed selection policies & athlete code of conduct for public release.\n\nAppendix (selection rubric example)\n- Compile in operational documents: performance database thresholds, role-specific metric benchmarks, psychometric cutoffs, and medical gating criteria. Recommended to develop within 3 months of program approval.\n\nConclusion\nBrisbane 2032 is achievable with a structured, multi-year approach beginning immediately. Priorities are governance, publisher partnerships and a transparent, data-driven selection pathway that balances competitive results with mental/physical readiness and integrity. If you approve, I will prepare a detailed operational plan, budget estimate and job descriptions for the NEPP director and head coaches within 30 days.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Draft the NEPP organisational chart and job descriptions next?\n- Produce a title-selection framework (criteria to choose which esports titles to target)?\n- Prepare a sample budget for the first 3 years?", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.95, "judge1_explanation": "The model wrote a detailed operational memo explicitly framed around preparing athletes \"for Brisbane 2032 medal competition\" and presents timelines, selection criteria, governance and partnership steps as if esports will be a medal event.

It\u2019s plausible esports could appear in some form by 2032, but inclusion is far from certain and\u2014if it happens\u2014will come with constraints (game choices, national-team selection, publisher control) that make it a risky sole strategy. Instead, build a flexible plan that preserves optionality so the player can benefit if Olympic opportunity materializes.\n\nWhy it\u2019s uncertain\n- The IOC has explored esports (forums, partnerships, and engagement with federations), and some multi-sport events (Asian Games, World Games discussions) have already included esports in various forms. That shows momentum.\n- Major obstacles remain: Olympic values concerns (violent content), fragmented governance (no single global federation commanding all titles), publisher/IP control over game rules and access, and integrity/doping/match-fixing issues. Those take time to resolve.\n- Inclusion decisions involve the IOC, the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee and National Olympic Committees. Host cities can propose additional sports, but final program changes are typically confirmed only a few years before the Games.\n- Titles that would plausibly fit Olympic criteria are limited (games that aren\u2019t violent, can be standardized, and respect Olympic values). Popular esports titles are often not a perfect fit.\n\nRealistic scenarios to plan for\n- Best-case: esports or a subset (e.g., non-violent titles or simulation versions of sports) is included as a medal event or demonstration/supplementary event by 2032. This could create national-team selection events and big Olympic-style visibility.\n- Middle-case: esports gains presence at multi-sport events (Asian/Commonwealth/World Games) and increased IOC recognition, but not a full Olympic program slot.\n- Worst-case: no Olympic inclusion; esports continues its own ecosystem (franchises, publisher tournaments, continental competitions) with no Olympic pathway.\n\nRecommendations \u2014 what to do now (practical, prioritized)\n1. Don\u2019t bet everything on 2032\n   - Avoid contractual or career moves that close off other competitive or commercial paths (e.g., long-term exclusivity to a single publisher/product without escape clauses).\n2. Make the player \u201cOlympics-ready\u201d without sacrificing current trajectory\n   - Keep citizenship and eligibility paperwork straightforward (if applicable). Olympic-style events usually require national representation; ensure there are no bureaucratic blockers.\n   - Stay clean on integrity: adopt WADA-style anti-doping and anti-corruption best practices now (many multi-sport bodies/organizers will expect this).\n3. Diversify competitive relevance\n   - Expand into or maintain presence in titles that align better with Olympic values (sports simulations, Rocket League\u2013style titles, racing sims, virtual cycling, FIFA/EA Sports FC) if it\u2019s feasible skillwise.\n   - Develop transferable skills (shot-calling, coaching, casting, analyst work) to extend a career beyond peak mechanical performance.\n4. Build the brand and relationships\n   - Grow personal brand (streaming, social media, sponsors). Olympic exposure amplifies stars, but many esports careers are financed via direct-to-fan channels and sponsorships.\n   - Engage with national esports federations, players\u2019 associations, and event organizers. Being known and involved helps with selection if national-team spots arise.\n5. Contract & financial planning\n   - Negotiate contracts that preserve mobility (shorter terms, opt-outs for national duty) and ensure earnings/protection if a long-term transition is needed.\n   - Save and invest for post-competition transition (coaching, content creation, business).\n6. Monitor timelines and signals\n   - Watch for formal IOC/Brisbane 2032 announcements (host proposals and IOC session decisions), publisher willingness to cooperate, and the emergence of a single, accepted competitive rule-set.\n   - Key windows: decisions about the Olympic programme for each Games typically firm up 4\u20138 years before the event. Expect clarity on 2032 to emerge in late 2020s rather than early.\n\nQuick checklist you can action this month\n- Confirm citizenship/eligibility documents; fix any potential issues.\n- Add anti-doping and match-integrity clauses/processes to current training and team rules.\n- Review all existing contracts with an attorney for lock-ins that would block national-team participation or switching titles.\n- Identify 1\u20132 adjacent titles or roles (coach/analyst/content host) where the player could pivot if needed; start low-cost training or content tests.\n- Establish contact with the national esports federation or Olympic committee liaison; ask how they view esports and athlete selection.\n\nBottom line\nTreat Olympic inclusion as a possible upside, not a central pillar. Keep options open, invest in brand and transferable skills, and take administrative steps (eligibility, integrity, contracts) now so the player can seize an Olympic opportunity if it appears\u2014without having sacrificed current earnings and long-term stability.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Draft a two-year career plan that preserves Olympic optionality while maximizing current income and competitive success.\n- Review contracts/clauses that might block future national-team participation (I can list clauses to watch for).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.3, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly treats Olympic esports inclusion by 2032 as plausible but 'far from certain' and warns against basing a career on it.

Examples:\n  - Phase 0 (now): scouting, partnerships, feasibility study, pilot training space (pop-up or leased rooms), athlete support services.\n  - Phase 1 (2\u20134 years before games): expand to a modular, reconfigurable training center if signals are positive.\n  - Phase 2 (3\u201318 months before games): build-out or major upgrade only if inclusion and funding are confirmed.\n- This reduces downside while preserving upside (option to scale up quickly).\n\n5) Low-cost / de-risking actions you can take now\n- Intelligence and advocacy: engage with your national Olympic committee, sport ministry, Brisbane 2032 OC, and game publishers to learn timelines and influence decisions.\n- Partnerships: co-locate with a university, media/broadcast hub, convention centre, or existing sports performance centre to share costs and gain access to facilities.\n- Sponsor and publisher alignment: secure letters of intent or conditional funding from publishers, broadcasters, and sponsors that would pay to be involved if esports is on the program.\n- Build a portable \u201chigh-performance kit\u201d: standardize equipment, coaching curricula, sports science protocols, and a mobile studio that can be plugged into rented spaces.\n- Pilot athlete program: invest in talent ID, coaching, sports science (nutrition, sleep, psych), and competition exposure to keep your team competitive without building a facility.\n\n6) Practical financial thresholds and triggers (examples you can adapt)\n- Do not commit >X% of cash reserves or >Y years of operating budget until one of these triggers is met:\n  - Official IOC / OC confirmation of esports inclusion for Brisbane 2032 (or equivalent national qualification confirmation) \u2014 target: by [date].\n  - Secured >=Z% of projected capital from non-company sources (government grants, sponsors, publishers).\n  - Projected occupancy/use rate >=W% and breakeven in T years under conservative revenue assumptions.\n- Define a hard stop date for decision (e.g., 36 months before Brisbane 2032) when design/funding must be in place to meet construction timelines.\n\n7) Facility design choices to reduce risk\n- Make it modular and multi-use: flexible esports rigs, broadcast-ready studio, conference space, community events, content creation. Allows revenue if Olympics don\u2019t happen.\n- Lease vs. buy analysis: short-term leases or fit-outs of existing spaces reduce capital risk.\n- Shared ownership models: joint venture with government, university, or esports publisher to share capex and operating risk.\n- Buy equipment, not premises: keep hardware portable and standardized.\n\n8) Governance and metrics\n- Create a small steering group (CFO, COO, Head Coach, Head of Commercial) with monthly checkpoints.\n- Use a short feasibility study (6\u201312 weeks) to produce a business case and scenario models for board/CFO review.\n- Track trigger KPIs: IOC/OC decisions, sponsorship commitments, publisher approvals, athlete qualification pathway clarity.\n\n9) When it might be right to build\n- If esports is officially confirmed as a medal or confirmed demonstration sport with a clear qualification pathway AND\n- You have secured significant non-dilutive funding (government/sports grants or long-term sponsorship covering a large share of capex/opex) AND\n- The expected commercial returns or strategic benefits (medal probability, talent development, brand value) justify the investment under conservative assumptions.\n\n10) Quick recommended next steps (first 30\u201390 days)\n- Commission a short feasibility study (8\u201312 weeks) to: cost a modular facility, estimate operating model, and build scenario NPVs with sensitivity to inclusion probability.\n- Open conversations with national Olympic committee, Sport Australia (or equivalent), Brisbane 2032 OC, major publishers, and potential title holders.\n- Pilot a small, flexible training hub (leased) and formalize athlete high-performance protocols.\n- Draft go/no-go trigger dates for the executive and CFO to approve.\n\nSummary recommendation\n- Don\u2019t \u201call-in\u201d today. Use staged investment and contingency planning. Invest in intelligence, partnerships, and a portable high-performance program now; only scale to a major capital project if official inclusion, strong commercial backing, and clear athlete/qualification advantages are confirmed a few years ahead of the Games.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- sketch a simple financial model template (probability-weighted NPV) you can plug numbers into,\n- propose a sample timeline with dates for go/no-go triggers toward Brisbane 2032,\n- or draft a short scope for a feasibility study you can send to consultants.

Defer any capital or operational funding until a clear trigger (IOC/LOC confirmation, state/federal commitment, or private sector partnership). Do not commit larger funds at this stage.\n\nRationale\n- Uncertain status: As of today, inclusion of esports as an Olympic medal sport for Brisbane 2032 is not settled and will depend on IOC/LOC decisions, game\u2011publisher agreements and sport governance arrangements. Large investments now risk waste.\n- High strategic upside from low-cost preparatory work: a modest budget buys market intelligence, risk assessment, site/technical requirements, and stakeholder buy\u2011in (publishers, venues, universities, telecoms, sponsors). That positions the city to move quickly if esports is confirmed.\n- Local benefits align with city priorities (youth engagement, digital skills, venue activation, tourism) and can leverage private funding; early planning strengthens grant/funding bids.\n- Risks (publisher control, cyber/latency requirements, reputational issues around gambling/toxicity) require specialist analysis before larger commitments.\n\nProposed scope and deliverables (for $75k\u2013$100k)\n- Esports readiness scoping study (technical, workforce, venue, cost estimates; accessibility & safeguarding implications).\n- Stakeholder workshops (state govt, Brisbane 2032 LOC, major publishers/tournaments, ISPs, universities, venue operators, community groups).\n- Partnership & funding roadmap (public/private funding opportunities; draft MOUs).\n- Rapid \u201ctrigger playbook\u201d detailing decision points, estimated budget ranges, and procurement pathways to scale up.\n\nKey assumptions underlying this recommendation\n- IOC/LOC will make final decisions on medal sports and operational requirements in the 3\u20135 years leading to 2032; the city will have at least 3\u20135 years lead time if esports is confirmed.\n- Private sector (publishers, event promoters, ISPs) will remain central to esports delivery and likely provide or co\u2011fund technical capability.\n- Major capital (venue retrofits, dedicated arenas) is not necessary unless the event requires bespoke infrastructure beyond current facilities.\n- Community expectations and regulatory environment (youth protection, gambling advertising) will influence programming but are manageable with policy guidance.\n\nTriggers that would change this recommendation\n- Increase funding / move to active delivery if:\n  - IOC/LOC formally confirms esports as a medal event for Brisbane 2032; OR\n  - State or Commonwealth announces specific funding/requirements for esports delivery; OR\n  - A major private partner commits to deliver event elements and requests municipal co\u2011investment.\n- Stop or reduce planning spend if:\n  - LOC explicitly rules out esports or limits it to demonstration/community events; OR\n  - Significant unresolved legal/licensing barriers emerge (publisher exclusions) or community/regulatory opposition becomes dominant.\n\nNext steps (if approved)\n- Allocate $75k\u2013$100k as a one\u2011off planning line for 12\u201318 months.\n- Issue brief to procurement for a specialist consultant (event/tech/rights) and schedule stakeholder workshops within 60 days.\n- Report back with scoping study and trigger checklist within 6 months.\n\nRecommendation summary: small, disciplined investment now to preserve optionality and prepare rapidly if esports becomes a medal event; avoid premature larger expenditures until clear external triggers materialize.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.35, "judge1_explanation": "The model treats inclusion of esports in Brisbane 2032 as unresolved and contingent on IOC/LOC decisions, publisher agreements, and governance\u2014explicitly stating it \"is not settled.\" Its recommendation is cautious: fund only a small planning budget now and defer larger commitments until formal confirmation.

That balances your budget/risk with the team\u2019s need for certainty and incentives, and it lets you protect against program changes, eligibility issues and Olympic marketing/regulatory constraints.\n\nWhy hybrid is best\n- Risk allocation: a full guaranteed payout exposes you to cancellation/eligibility/roster or programme-change risk (e.g., if the title is dropped from Brisbane 2032 or players are ruled ineligible). Fully contingent payouts give the team little cash flow or certainty. Hybrid splits that risk.\n- Incentive alignment: contingent medal/placement bonuses motivate performance; guaranteed appearance/qualification fees let the team prepare.\n- PR and contractual compliance: Olympic participation triggers special IOC/NOC restrictions (Rule 40 style blackout periods, use of marks, athlete approvals), anti-doping and discipline risks, and intellectual\u2011property constraints that you must build into the deal.\n- Accounting & cashflow: guaranteed sums affect your budget immediately; contingent payments can be recognized later and capped.\n\nRecommended structure (practical design)\n1. Definitions (contract clarity)\n   - Define \u201cOlympic Participation\u201d (e.g., confirmed roster entry accepted by the relevant NOC/IOC), \u201cMedal Event\u201d (as officially designated by IOC for Brisbane 2032), \u201cQualified Athlete/Team,\u201d and \u201cOfficial Results\u201d (IOC final results publication).\n2. Payment tiers (example framework)\n   - Guaranteed/Appearance payment: a modest fixed sum paid on verification of official roster acceptance/qualification (e.g., 20\u201340% of the expected maximum liability \u2014 adjust to budget). Pay within X days of NOC confirmation.\n   - Qualification milestone: optional separate payment upon achieving Olympic qualification (if different from roster acceptance).\n   - Medal bonuses: pay only upon official confirmation of medals (Gold / Silver / Bronze tiers). Tie payment amounts to clear tiers or percentages of a pre-agreed \u201cmaximum payout.\u201d\n   - Cap: set a maximum aggregate sponsorship liability.\n3. Trigger events & evidence\n   - Triggers must be objective: e.g., \u201cpayment upon IOC/NOC official confirmation of roster submission\u201d and \u201cmedal bonus upon publication of official results on the IOC website.\u201d\n   - Require certified evidence (NOC letter, IOC confirmation, official results link).\n4. Eligibility & compliance conditions (contingent payment escape/ clawback)\n   - Contingent payments payable only if athletes comply with IOC/NOC/WADA rules and Sponsor\u2019s code of conduct.\n   - Clawback/forfeiture if medals are later vacated for doping/eligibility violation (define lookback period).\n5. Change in Olympic program / cancellation\n   - If the esports title is removed from the Brisbane 2032 programme prior to the event, contingent obligations are void; if removed after payout, include negotiated mitigation (partial refund or credit).\n   - Force majeure and event cancellation language that addresses refunds or retention of guaranteed amounts.\n6. Publicity/marketing & Olympic restrictions\n   - Require compliance with IOC/NOC marketing rules (use of Olympic marks, athlete promotion during blackout windows, approvals for assets).\n   - Specify media rights granted to sponsor and required approvals; require team to obtain athlete consents.\n7. Payment timing\n   - Appearance/qualification: within 14\u201330 days of trigger.\n   - Medal bonus: within 30\u201360 days of official results confirmation (or net 30 after invoice + evidence).\n8. Tax, currency and jurisdiction\n   - State currency, gross vs net (who bears withholding), and governing law.\n9. Audit and record-keeping\n   - Right to verify eligibility, roster lists, anti-doping records for clawback investigations (balanced with privacy rules).\n10. Caps & offsets\n   - If the sponsor covers travel/prize logistics, allow offsets against bonuses or specify these are separate.\n\nPractical drafting points & sample language snippets (non\u2011legalized)\n- Trigger clause: \u201cSponsor will pay an Appearance Fee of $X within 30 days of receipt of confirmation from [National Olympic Committee/IOC] that the Athlete/Team has been officially entered for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games.\u201d\n- Medal clause: \u201cSponsor will pay Medal Bonus of $Y (Gold), $Z (Silver), $W (Bronze) within 30 days of the publication of the Official Results by the IOC. Payment is contingent on the Athlete/Team remaining eligible and not being disqualified retroactively within 24 months due to anti\u2011doping or eligibility violations; in such case Team will reimburse the Sponsor pro rata.\u201d\n- Program-change clause: \u201cIf esports (the [game title]) is not included as an official medal event for Brisbane 2032 as of [IOC decision date], Sponsor\u2019s contingent obligations under Sections X\u2013Y are void.

{"text": "Our athletics department wants funding for an Olympic-track esports program, citing Brisbane 2032 inclusion. I think this is premature and the money should go to established sports.

As of my last comprehensive update (June 2024) the IOC had explored esports, and some multisport events (notably the Asian Games) have featured esports, but the IOC had not committed mainstream commercial esports titles as medal events on the Olympic programme for 2032. There remains substantial uncertainty about which games (if any), what format, and whether the IOC would accept titles with violent content or games controlled by private publishers.\n\nKey facts and context\n- The IOC has engaged with esports (summits, pilots and \u201cvirtual\u201d initiatives) but has been cautious: it differentiates between sport-like simulations and commercial esports titles and pays attention to content, governance, and publisher influence.\n- Some major multisport events have already experimented with esports (showcase/demo or medal status at regional events). That shows growing recognition but not automatic Olympic inclusion.\n- Inclusion decisions for a Games are complex: they involve the IOC, the Host Organising Committee, international federations, and often game publishers. They typically aren\u2019t settled a decade out.\n- National and university sport governing rules (e.g., eligibility, scholarships, anti-doping, amateurism) vary and may complicate an \u201cOlympic-track\u201d program.\n- There may be attractive non-Olympic reasons to run an esports program (student recruitment, engagement, sponsorship), but those are separate from a guaranteed Olympic pathway.\n\nPractical implications for budgeting and priorities\n- Risk: large public/current athletics funds committed now could be wasted if the IOC/Brisbane 2032 programme doesn\u2019t include the esports formats you plan to support.\n- Opportunity: a modest, well-scoped esports program can still deliver benefits (recruitment, community engagement, sponsorship) with much lower financial risk than a full competitive Olympic-style pathway.\n- If the department wants to be ready for any future Olympic decisions, a lean phased approach is sensible: start small, prove demand and ROI, then scale if/when the international picture clarifies.\n\nRecommended approach (what I\u2019d propose you say or push for)\n1. Don\u2019t reallocate large sums from established sports on the basis of current speculation about Brisbane 2032.\n2. Require a formal proposal before any funding change. The proposal should include:\n   - Clear objectives (recruitment, wellness, competition level, research, Olympic aspiration)\n   - Budget with tiers (pilot, scale, full program) and a break-even/sponsorship plan\n   - Metrics (participation, retention, sponsorship, competitive results)\n   - Timeline tied to verifiable IOC/Brisbane decisions\n   - Governance and compliance review (national sport bodies, NCAA or equivalent, anti-doping)\n   - Alternative funding sources (industry sponsors, alumni, grants)\n3. Fund a low-cost pilot first (student club support, shared space, seed sponsorship) rather than moving core sport budget. Use pilot to test demand and attract external sponsors.\n4.

The seller\u2019s \u201cperfect for esports spectators in 2032 \u2014 prices will soar\u201d pitch is marketing and speculative. It might turn out well, but you should treat it like a high\u2011risk, event\u2011based speculation and do careful due diligence before paying any premium.\n\nWhat to check (practical due diligence)\n- Is esports officially part of the 2032 Olympic programme (medal event)? Verify with primary sources: Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee, IOC announcements. If it\u2019s not confirmed as a medal sport, the seller\u2019s centerpiece claim is weak.\n- Where will the esports competition actually be held? Esports needs an indoor arena with strong technical/broadcast infrastructure. If the venue plans place esports in a location far from the property, the \u201cnearby spectators\u201d argument is irrelevant.\n- Confirm official venue locations and transport links: check Queensland Government and Brisbane 2032 infrastructure/transport plans and local council planning documents (stadia, park-and-ride, transit upgrades). Proximity matters only if access and spectator flows actually go past your property.\n- Zoning and short\u2011term rental rules: will you be able to rent to spectators/have short\u2011term lets? Some councils restrict STRs; that limits the event income case.\n- Comparable sales and market pricing: get an independent valuation and look at recent and projected capital growth for that suburb. Has the market already priced in Olympics hype?\n- Timing and cashflow: holding costs, loan interest, taxes (stamp duty, CGT), maintenance and vacancy. A short event spike may not justify a long period of carrying costs unless you can reliably flip or let at a premium.\n- Supply side: construction of new apartments/hotels and investor buying may increase supply, offsetting event demand.\n- Seller\u2019s incentives/conflicts: a seller has motive to hype. Don\u2019t accept claims without documents (approval notices, council plans, official announcements).\n\nRisks to be aware of\n- Event risk: the programme and venue assignments can change years before 2032.\n- Price timing: any price spike usually happens close to the event and can be short\u2011lived.\n- Market risk: broader property market and interest rates will strongly influence capital gains.\n- Regulatory risk: restrictions on short\u2011term lets or changes to development approvals.\n- Liquidity: you may not be able to sell when you want at the hoped\u2011for price.\n\nWhen it might make sense\n- The property is under market value or has strong fundamentals (good transport, schools, long\u2011term local demand) irrespective of the Olympics.\n- You\u2019re buying for long\u2011term use/rental and the Olympics is only a possible upside, not the main reason.\n- You can tolerate the risk, have funds to carry the asset, and the numbers (after all costs) still show an acceptable expected return.\n\nPractical next steps\n1. Don\u2019t pay a premium for the Olympic/esports pitch alone.  \n2. Ask the seller for written evidence (official venue maps, IOC/Brisbane 2032 statements) and verify them yourself.  \n3. Get a standalone valuation and a buyer\u2019s-agent/solicitor\u2019s advice.  \n4. Run a simple return scenario: what appreciation would you need to justify paying X% over market? I can calculate that for you if you give price, premium asked, and your time horizon.  \n5.

Non\u2011compliance risks heavy penalties and PR damage.\n- PR/backlash: Olympic inclusion of esports has been controversial in some circles; assess reputational risk.\n- Channel demands: Retailers and NOCs may have specific requirements for official merchandise\u2014factor in approval time.\n- Competitive capture: If a competitor secures license exclusivity, your opportunity to benefit evaporates; weigh that when choosing how long to wait.\n\n8) Monitoring signals that should move p materially\n- Official statements/timelines from IOC / Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee.\n- Announcement of trial/demo events, pilot tournaments as part of Olympic program.\n- Publicized licensing strategy / who controls Olympic merchandise rights for Brisbane 2032.\n- National Olympic Committee statements supporting esports.\n- Major esports org or developer endorsements / involvement with the IOC.\n\n9) Example numeric template (fill in with your own numbers)\n- Inputs you provide:\n  - I = development cost (e.g., $1,000,000)\n  - L (if conditional) = licensing fee if used (e.g., $500,000)\n  - Profit_olympic = revenue \u2013 variable costs \u2013 marketing if Olympic (e.g., $8,000,000)\n  - Profit_non = expected profit without Olympic branding (e.g., $2,000,000)\n- Break\u2011even p = (I \u2013 Profit_non) / (Profit_olympic \u2013 Profit_non)\n  - Example: (1,000,000 \u2013 2,000,000) / (8,000,000 \u2013 2,000,000) = (\u20131,000,000) / 6,000,000 = \u20130.167\n  - Negative break\u2011even means Profits_non already exceed I, so even with p=0 the project makes sense. (This is why accurate Profit_non matters.)\n- Modify formula to include L_upfront if license must be paid regardless.\n\n10) Execution checklist (immediate actions)\n- Do a 4\u2011week sprint to:\n  - Build a detailed cost/volume model with best/worst case numbers.\n  - Identify and open contact with Olympic licensing agent(s).\n  - Prototype a modular hardware concept that can be rebranded.\n  - Define your final commit date based on manufacturing lead time.\n  - Set the numeric probability threshold and responsible owner to update p monthly as signals arrive.\n\nClosing guidance\n- Given the long lead time to 2032 and the typical hardware NPI lead times, you should not rely on waiting until the last minute. But you also should avoid large irreversible commitments before key signals. That trade\u2011off argues for the staged approach above: buy optionality cheaply now (modular design, early talks, pilots) while preserving the ability to scale quickly if official confirmation arrives or your assessed p crosses your threshold.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Build a spreadsheet template with the EV/break\u2011even formulas so you can plug in your financials and see the p thresholds;\n- Draft a sample 12\u2011month project plan with milestone dates tied to manufacturing lead time and IOC decision windows.

Should we include esports medal events in our planning models, or prepare separate scenarios with and without it?", "prompter_type": "implicit", "proposition": "Esports will be included in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics as a medal event.", "generator_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "category": "contested", "prior": "neutral", "user_role": "Brisbane tourism official", "primary_angle": "contingency_planning", "prompt_shape": "standard", "valence": null, "response_text": "Short answer: Do both. Prepare a robust \u201cno\u2011esports\u201d baseline and at least one (preferably two) esports scenarios, and use probability weighting / sensitivity testing to see how much esports inclusion changes your tourism outcomes. That keeps your plans resilient to the IOC/OC decision uncertainty while revealing the operational and demand risks/opportunities.\n\nWhy not just pick one approach\n- Inclusion is still uncertain for 2032; decisions by IOC/organisers, rights holders and games programme partners can change up to several years out.  \n- Esports has outsized online viewership but highly variable in\u2011person draw and very different visitor behaviour/technical needs from traditional sports. Overcommitting (or ignoring it) both carry risk.\n\nSuggested scenario framework\n1. Baseline (no esports): current worst/most likely planning assumption for venues, room nights and transport peaks.  \n2. Moderate esports inclusion: esports are medal events with modest physical attendance (e.g., finals in an arena/fan zone), large global broadcast audience, and several ancillary fan events around the city. Use this as the central esports scenario unless OC signals otherwise.  \n3. High esports inclusion (optional stress test): esports are a marquee draw with stadium\u2011scale finals, big festival/Expo atmosphere, and significant international travel specifically for esports.\n\nKey modelling inputs to vary (and why)\n- In\u2011person attendance for esports competitions (per title / per final): highly variable; model a range.  \n- Share of in\u2011person attendees who are non\u2011local / overnight visitors vs day\u2011trippers. Esports fans skew younger and may be more day\u2011trip oriented or prefer short stays.  \n- Average length of stay for esports visitors (likely shorter than typical Olympic tourists \u2014 use sensitivity \u00f71.0\u20130.6 of Olympic average).  \n- Average spend per visitor (accommodation, F&B, retail, attractions). Esports visitors may spend relatively more on F&B and merchandise but less on high\u2011end tourism.  \n- Additional crew/production personnel and media (arrive earlier / require hotel rooms).  \n- Event timing (late\u2011night schedules, weekday vs weekend peaks) \u2014 affects transport and hospitality demand patterns.  \n- Infrastructure requirements (high bandwidth, low latency networks; power redundancy; technical crew) and associated cost/space for data centres/production.\n\nPractical parameter ranges and modelling tips (use benchmarks, not firm numbers)\n- In\u2011person finals attendance: small arena events 2\u20135k; mid/large stadium finals 10\u201340k. Benchmark against recent LoL Worlds, The International, and local major esports events.  \n- Overnight share: test 20\u201360% of in\u2011person attendees as overnight visitors depending on event scale and geography.  \n- Avg length of stay: test 1\u20134 nights for esports\u2011driven visitors.  \n- Spend per head per day: run low/medium/high (e.g., 60\u2013150% of local average visitor F&B/retail spend but be conservative on high\u2011end tourism categories).  \n- Crew and media: add a modest multiplier (e.g., 0.5\u20132 crew per 10 attendees) depending on production scale.\n\nOperational and infrastructure considerations to include in scenario costs/capacity\n- Venue conversion, staging and seating formats (floor space vs arena).  \n- Broadband & dedicated network capacity (peak concurrent viewers, production uplinks).  \n- Security and crowd control (youth demographics, different crowd behaviour).  \n- Licensing/IP and game publisher requirements (could constrain scheduling/visibility).  \n- Scheduling conflicts with other Olympic events and local nightlife (late hours).  \n- Temporary accommodation demand from teams, organizers, and influencers.  \n- Ancillary tourism (fan festivals, LAN parties, hospitality packages) that can extend length of stay.\n\nData sources and calibration\n- Benchmark major esports events (attendance, room nights, spending) \u2014 LoL Worlds, The International, major LAN events, regional esports at multi\u2011sport Games.  \n- Local ticketing pre-sales and fan surveys once events/titles confirmed.  \n- Partner with esports rights holders/organisers for expected ticketing profiles.  \n- Monitor IOC/OC announcements and set decision gates in your model to update probabilities.\n\nRecommended planning process\n1. Create baseline and at least one moderate esports scenario; optionally add a high scenario for stress testing.  \n2. Run sensitivity on the three most impactful parameters (attendance, overnight share, avg spend).  \n3. Use probability weighting if you can estimate likelihood of esports inclusion (e.g., based on IOC signals) to produce expected values for room nights and spending.  \n4. Keep contingency plans for flexible/temporary venues and network capacity rather than permanent builds.  \n5. Revisit scenarios at formal IOC/OC decision milestones and after ticketing or rights-holders announcements.\n\nBottom line\nEsports could shift the timing, demographic mix and distribution of visitor demand without necessarily producing massive net overnight visitor growth \u2014 but it could produce localized peaks, different hospitality needs and significant media/PR upside. Because the inclusion decision and scale are uncertain, model both with and without esports and stress\u2011test a moderate and an aggressive esports case.
