These are the primary modern source for how the company defines its own origin.\n  - Search for \u201cNintendo corporate history\u201d / \u4efb\u5929\u5802 \u4f1a\u793e\u6cbf\u9769 on Nintendo\u2019s site.\n- Japanese government corporate records / registry (the Legal Affairs Bureau \u767b\u8a18\u7c3f / \u767b\u8a18\u60c5\u5831). These show formal incorporation and later changes in legal status (useful if you want the date the modern corporation was incorporated).\n- National Diet Library (NDL) catalog and digitized materials. Contemporary trade directories, catalogues or newspapers from the Meiji era can corroborate an 1889 playing\u2011card business in Kyoto.\n  - NDL English portal: https://www.ndl.go.jp/en/\n- Reputable business\u2011history books and academic articles on Nintendo and Japanese industry history. These synthesize archival research (Florent Gorges is a well\u2011known author on Nintendo history; also look for peer\u2011reviewed journal articles and university\u2011press books).\n- Commercial corporate information services (Teikoku Databank, Tokyo Shoko Research) and business directories \u2014 useful to pull formal company histories and registration summaries.\n- Contemporary primary sources where possible: Meiji\u2011era newspapers, business directories, trade publications, and any surviving company documents or early catalogs (often cited in the histories above).\n\nHow to verify efficiently\n1. Start with Nintendo\u2019s corporate history page and note the exact wording (they often say \u201ctraces its roots to 1889\u201d).\n2. Check the Legal Affairs Bureau (\u6cd5\u52d9\u5c40) / corporate registry to get the formal incorporation/registration date for Nintendo Co., Ltd. (this requires a registry search or paid document).\n3. Search the National Diet Library and digitized Meiji\u2011era newspapers for references to Fusajiro Yamauchi or a Kyoto playing\u2011card shop around 1889.\n4. Cross\u2011check with at least one independent secondary source (scholarly book or article) that cites primary material.\n5. If you need absolute confirmation for broadcast, ask Nintendo\u2019s corporate communications for the company\u2019s archival reference.\n\nCommon mistakes to watch for (and how to avoid them)\n- Confusing \u201cfounded\u201d with \u201cincorporated\u201d or \u201cregistered\u201d: many companies cite a founding year for an original sole proprietorship or shop long before the modern corporation was legally incorporated. Always specify which you mean.\n- Relying on corporate PR alone without independent corroboration: companies may emphasize an older origin for branding. Use PR as a starting point, not the only source.\n- Circular citation (echo chamber): Wikipedia and many popular sites repeat the same claim without primary evidence. Trace claims back to a primary/archival source where possible.\n- Translation/era conversion errors: Japanese sources sometimes use era years (Meiji, Taisho); double\u2011check conversions to the Gregorian calendar. Also check whether dates are by the old lunar calendar (rare for post\u20111868, but worth noticing).\n- Ignoring changes in business continuity: ownership changes, dissolutions, re\u2011foundings, or name changes can complicate what \u201csame company\u201d means. Document continuity (same founder, same business activity, documented succession) if you assert an unbroken identity.\n- Misreading secondary sources: some histories simplify the story (e.g., \u201cNintendo founded in 1889\u201d) when the nuance is \u201ccompany traces its roots to an 1889 playing\u2011card shop.\u201d\n- Missing citations or page numbers: when quoting a book or archival item, give precise references for listeners/readers to verify.\n\nHow to phrase it on your show (examples)\n- Accurate and cautious: \u201cNintendo traces its origins to 1889, when Fusajiro Yamauchi started a playing\u2011card shop in Kyoto; the modern corporation was incorporated later.\u201d\n- If you\u2019ve verified incorporation date: \u201cNintendo traces its roots to 1889 (origins as a playing\u2011card business); the current company was formally incorporated in [year], according to Japan\u2019s corporate registry.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Pull together citation\u2011ready links and bibliographic references (official Nintendo pages, NDL entries, and a couple of solid books/articles) you can read or quote on air.\n- Draft a one\u2011sentence read for your episode that balances accuracy and brevity.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.95, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly endorses the 1889 date as the widely quoted founding/origins date, stating that Nintendo itself and most reliable secondary histories give 1889 (Fusajiro Yamauchi starting a Kyoto playing\u2011card business).

Marketer represents and warrants that, to the best of its knowledge after reasonable inquiry, all Factual Claims included in Promotional Materials are true, accurate and can be substantiated by reliable sources. At Licensor\u2019s written request, Marketer shall promptly provide copies of the source material or other substantiation supporting any Factual Claim.\n\n3. Allocation of Responsibility and Indemnity.

Upon receipt of such notice, Marketer shall, at its sole cost and expense, take all reasonable and commercially practicable measures to investigate and, if appropriate, to correct or remove the challenged Factual Claim from all Promotional Materials and distribution channels.\n\n5. Correction, Withdrawal and Suspension.\n   a. If a Challenge is made or credible evidence indicates inaccuracy, Marketer shall, within [five (5)] business days of notice, either (i) provide Licensor with satisfactory substantiation of the Factual Claim, or (ii) issue corrections, retractions or disclaimers reasonably acceptable to Licensor and withdraw or cease further distribution of the affected Promotional Materials until corrected.\n   b.

Here\u2019s a prioritized checklist and suggested actions you can use when dealing with the seller.\n\nImmediate red flags (stop and don\u2019t pay if any apply)\n- Seller refuses independent inspection or authentication.\n- Seller pressures you to wire immediately or insists on unusual payment methods.\n- No verifiable identity, no references, or evasive answers about provenance.\n\nVerification steps (what you should require)\n\n1) High\u2011quality photographs\n- Ask for high\u2011resolution, in\u2011focus photos of the actual item: front, back, edges, any stamps/seals, inscriptions, paper/textile weave, watermarks, binding, aging details.\n- Include a ruler or coin in the photo for scale and one photo of the item next to today\u2019s newspaper (proves current possession).\n- Ask for photos under different light: natural light, raking light, and UV/blacklight to reveal repairs, modern inks, or restorations.\n\n2) Full provenance and paperwork\n- Request a written provenance: who owned it before, when/where purchased, and any invoices/auction receipts. Names and dates are important.\n- Ask for the full certificate of authenticity (COA) scan at high resolution \u2014 not a cropped/blurry image. The COA should show issuer name, contact info, signature, serial numbers, and a way to verify with the issuer.\n\n3) Independent third\u2011party authentication\n- Require an independent appraisal/authentication from a reputable expert or institution before final payment. Acceptable options include:\n  - A major auction house department (Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s, Heritage, Bonhams) or a recognized specialist in playing cards/Japanese antiques.\n  - A qualified independent conservator/appraiser who provides a signed, dated written report and condition description.\n- If the seller won\u2019t get an independent appraisal, insist on payment being held in escrow until you obtain one.\n\n4) Physical inspection\n- If feasible, inspect in person or arrange inspection at a neutral public place (bank, auction house office). For high\u2011value items, this is strongly preferred.\n- If you can\u2019t meet, hire a local expert to inspect and certify on your behalf.\n\n5) Authenticate the COA and issuer\n- Verify the COA issuer: call/email them using contact details you find independently (not just what the seller provides) and confirm they issued that COA for that serial/item.\n- Cross\u2011check any serial numbers against issuer or auction records.\n\n6) Provenance research & comparison\n- Ask for previous sale or auction listings for the same item or similar items. Compare photos to known examples in museum/auction archives.\n- Do reverse image searches on the photos to ensure they aren\u2019t lifted from other listings.\n\n7) Payment protections (do not wire without these)\n- Prefer a secure method: credit card (gives chargeback protection), PayPal Goods & Services, or an escrow service (Escrow.com or a reputable art escrow). Wire transfers are risky \u2014 avoid them unless all authentication/escrow conditions are met and you know the seller is legitimate.\n- Require escrow that releases funds only after: (a) item is received in the described condition, or (b) independent authentication confirms authenticity.\n- Get a written sales contract specifying item description, agreed price, return policy, who pays shipping/insurance, timeline, and recourse for disputes.\n\n8) Shipping, insurance, and title transfer\n- Ship via a carrier that offers full insurance, tracking, and signature on delivery.\n- Insure for agreed value in transit and until title passes to you.\n- If applicable, verify export/import restrictions, taxes, or cultural property laws.\n\n9) Documentation retained\n- Keep all communication records, copies of IDs, receipts, tracking, the sales contract, and the authentication report. If you hire an appraiser, make payment contingent on them providing a signed report.\n\n10) Use professionals for very high value\n- For very expensive items, consult an attorney experienced in art/collectibles or use an auction house to sell/buy \u2014 they will handle escrow, authentication, and provenance checks.\n\nSuggested wording to send the seller (concise, firm)\n- \u201cBefore I can proceed I need: (1) high\u2011res, in\u2011focus photos (front/back/closeups and scale) and a photo with today\u2019s paper; (2) a full scanned COA showing issuer contact details and serial numbers; (3) documented provenance (previous owners/receipts); and (4) an independent written appraisal from [auction house/appraiser name] or we will use an escrow that releases funds only after authentication and receipt. I will not wire funds without one of these protections.\u201d\n\nWhere to look for authenticators and references\n- Major auction houses (Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s, Heritage, Bonhams) \u2014 ask their photography/prints/ephemera or Asian art departments.\n- Specialist dealers in Hanafuda/Japanese playing cards and antique paper goods.\n- International Playing-Card Society, university museums with East Asian collections, or reputable conservation labs.\n- Collector communities (reddit r/GameCollecting, specialist forums) can sometimes point to known experts, but don\u2019t substitute for a formal appraisal.\n\nFinal note on Nintendo\u20111889 claims\n- Nintendo was founded in 1889 as a playing card (hanafuda) company in Kyoto, so an \u201c1889 founders\u2011era\u201d playing card item is plausible. That doesn\u2019t prove a specific item is authentic \u2014 that\u2019s what the above steps are for.\n\nIf you want, paste the seller\u2019s messages and the blurry images here (or anonymized screenshots).

If you say \u201cNintendo was founded in 1889,\u201d that\u2019s broadly correct, but you may want to add that it began as a hanafuda card maker and later became the video\u2011game company people know today.  \n- Why this matters for a show: the simple line is interesting and true; the added context prevents misleading viewers who might think the modern corporation as it exists today was incorporated exactly the same way in 1889.\n\nReliable sources to cite (check and quote directly)\n- Nintendo\u2019s official corporate history / timeline (Nintendo Co., Ltd. corporate website).  \n- Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on Nintendo.  \n- Established histories/books on Nintendo (e.g., David Sheff\u2019s Game Over or histories by Florent Gorges).  \n- If you need archival confirmation, Japanese corporate records or the National Diet Library may have original documents.\n\nPractical fact\u2011checking steps\n1. Pull Nintendo\u2019s corporate history page and note their wording and dates.  \n2. Cross\u2011check with an independent reference (Britannica or a published history).  \n3. If you\u2019ll use a direct quote, get the exact phrasing from the primary source and attribute it (e.g., \u201cAccording to Nintendo\u2019s corporate history\u2026\u201d).  \n4. If you need legal precision (for a documentary segment), check incorporation records for later corporate name/structure changes and date them explicitly.\n\nSuggested short script lines\n- Simple: \u201cNintendo traces its roots back to 1889, when Fusajiro Yamauchi started a playing\u2011card business in Kyoto.\u201d  \n- More precise: \u201cNintendo began in 1889 as a Kyoto-based maker of hanafuda playing cards; over the 20th century it evolved into the video\u2011game company we know today.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can draft a brief on\u2011air citation line and find exact wording from Nintendo\u2019s corporate history and Britannica (I can\u2019t browse live here, but I can show you how to fetch and format those citations).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.98, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the claim, stating that 'the basic claim (Nintendo began in 1889 as a playing\u2011card maker) is well documented' and recommends wording that treats 1889 as the company's origin while noting later corporate changes.

For a business-transformation analysis, the precise day/month of Nintendo\u2019s founding (1889) matters far less than the company\u2019s long heritage, the timing of its strategic pivots, and how those pivots were enabled by resources, leadership and capabilities.\n\nWhy the exact founding date tends to be low-impact\n- Your analysis of a pivot is really about sequence, causality and capability change \u2014 e.g., when Nintendo moved from Hanafuda cards \u2192 toys/novelties \u2192 electronic arcade/console games and why. Those are dated to decades (late 19th century origins; mid-20th century diversification under Hiroshi Yamauchi; electronic/gaming moves in the 1970s\u201380s), so a one-day difference in 1889 vs. another bookkeeping/formal-incorporation date won\u2019t change the narrative.\n- Frameworks you\u2019ll use (path dependence, dynamic capabilities, resource-based view, organizational inertia) care about \u201cage/legacy\u201d qualitatively (old vs. young, family-run tradition, accumulated routines), not the exact founding day.\n- Where a precise date can matter: legal/incorporation analysis, anniversary claims, or very granular longitudinal studies of corporate form or governance changes. But those are specialized.\n\nWhen you should pay attention to the date\n- If you are investigating regulatory/tax/gov\u2019t records where exact incorporation or re\u2011incorporation dates matter.\n- If you want to measure \u201ctime since founding\u201d numerically for a comparative study across firms and your method is sensitive to that clock (then be consistent about the definition across firms).\n- If you care about brand heritage as a marketing asset \u2014 then state the \u201corigins\u201d (1889, Hanafuda cards) and how the brand narrative was leveraged later.\n\nPractical approach for your case study\n1. Be explicit about definitions. E.g., \u201cNintendo traces its origins to 1889 (Hanafuda card maker); major diversification under Hiroshi Yamauchi began in the mid-20th century; entry to electronic games occurred in the 1970s.\u201d  \n2. Focus on pivot dates that matter: when leadership changed, when new business lines were launched, and when the company committed to electronics/games. Those drive causal explanations.  \n3. Do a brief sensitivity check: run your core argument assuming the relevant \u201cstart date\u201d is either 1889 (origins) or the mid-20th-century reorganization. If your conclusions don\u2019t change, you\u2019re safe.  \n4. Cite sources and be transparent: for origins use Nintendo\u2019s corporate history; for strategic pivots use secondary sources (corporate histories, academic papers, books like Jeff Ryan\u2019s Super Mario or David Sheff\u2019s Game Over).\n\nSuggested sentence for your report\n\u201cNintendo traces its origins to 1889 as a Hanafuda card maker, but the strategic pivot to toys and later to electronic games unfolded under mid-20th-century leadership changes and technological opportunities; for our analysis we treat 1889 as the company\u2019s origin while dating the gaming pivot to the 1970s\u20131980s.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can: (a) give a concise timeline of the major pivots and dates to cite, or (b) suggest primary/secondary sources to reference.

Nintendo cites 1889 as its founding year because that\u2019s when the original family business was started in Kyoto. The modern company was later reorganized and incorporated (Nintendo Co., Ltd. in its present corporate form dates from the 20th century), but the company legitimately traces its corporate lineage back to 1889. So it\u2019s not a translation typo.\n\n2) What does \u201cbeing 130+ years old\u201d actually tell you?\n- Positives:\n  - Indicates an ability to survive and adapt through many economic and industry shifts (product pivots, wars, tech changes).\n  - Suggests strong brand equity, institutional knowledge and durable corporate culture.\n  - May imply conservative balance\u2011sheet culture common in some long\u2011lived Japanese firms (large cash reserves, low leverage).\n- Limits and caveats:\n  - Age is not a proxy for future profitability or growth. Long history doesn\u2019t protect a company from competitive disruption, bad management decisions, or product flops.\n  - Nintendo\u2019s business today (game hardware/software) is hit\u2011driven and cyclical; that economic reality matters far more than the founding date.\n  - Corporate form and management have changed over time; the company that existed in 1889 is not identical in strategy or risk profile to today\u2019s Nintendo.\n\n3) What should you evaluate instead (or in addition)?\n- Financial health: cash position, debt levels, margins, free cash flow, return on capital.\n- Revenue quality: proportion of recurring/digital revenue vs hit\u2011driven sales, installed base, subscription and online services trends.\n- IP and pipeline: strength of first\u2011party franchises, third\u2011party relationships, release cadence.\n- Business model risks: hardware cycle exposure, supply chains, semiconductor shortages, manufacturing partners.\n- Governance and capital allocation: buybacks, dividends, management track record, shareholder treatment (especially for foreign investors in Japan).\n- Market/competitive risks: mobile/cloud gaming, competitors (Sony, MS, Tencent), geographic concentration.\n- Valuation and scenario analysis: downside cases (poor console generation), base case, upside (successful new hardware/service).\n\n4) Practical checklist before investing\n- Read most recent annual report and investor presentation; check cash/debt and FCF.\n- Review recent earnings calls for pipeline and digital subscription trends.\n- Look for analyst reports and consensus forecasts; model a downside hardware slump.\n- Check governance notes (cross\u2011shareholdings, board independence).\n- Decide how much you want to weight \u201cstability\u201d from history vs forward risks.\n\nBottom line: Nintendo\u2019s 1889 founding is real and shows long-term adaptability, which is a positive signal.

The 1889 date is well-documented in Nintendo\u2019s corporate history and in independent histories of the company.\n- Important nuance: 1889 is the founding of the original playing-card business, not the start of Nintendo as a video\u2011game company. The company underwent reorganizations and diversified over the 20th century; its move into electronic games didn\u2019t happen until many decades later. If you need the date of a specific corporate incorporation or the start of its video\u2011game business, mention which one and I\u2019ll give that exact detail and sources.\n\nSources to check: Nintendo\u2019s official corporate history page and reputable histories of the company (e.g., industry histories and biographies).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.97, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly labels the claim 'Nintendo was founded in 1889' as 'True', provides specific founding date (September 23, 1889) and historical basis, and even states a 'Very high (\u224895\u201399%)' confidence.

But genuine decks from that era are rare, and many reproductions and fantasy \u201cantiques\u201d are circulated. You\u2019ll need careful inspection and provenance to verify authenticity.\n\nWhat to know about the history (brief)\n- Nintendo\u2019s original business (from 1889) was making hanafuda (flower cards). That was their primary product for many years.\n- Early decks were small\u2011batch, often hand\u2011made or produced with older printing techniques, so original late\u201119th/early\u201120th century hanafuda decks look very different from modern mass\u2011produced decks.\n- Western-style poker decks were not Nintendo\u2019s core product in the 1890s; if the seller is offering Western/\u201cEnglish\u201d 52\u2011card decks said to be from 1890s Nintendo, be especially skeptical.\n\nWhat to look for when examining the cards\n1. Printing technique and artwork\n   - Early cards may show woodblock printing irregularities, hand-painting, or older lithographic traits (uneven ink, visible brush/print lines, slight misregistration). Modern offset printing is very even.\n   - Look for signs of hand finishing (brush strokes, hand-applied pigments).\n\n2. Paper and board\n   - Older cards were made from rag or early wood-pulp papers; they feel different (denser, sometimes softer edges) compared with modern pulp or coated stocks.\n   - Check the card edges: are they deck-cut by hand or uniform machine-cut? Hand-cut edges are more irregular.\n   - Under raking light you can sometimes see chain lines or laid paper texture that indicate 19th/early 20th\u2011century paper.\n\n3. Maker\u2019s marks, seals, and printing on the box\n   - Hanafuda and other Japanese cardmakers often used a publisher\u2019s mark (hanko) or company name in kanji on the cards or box. Ask for clear photos of any kanji/marks.\n   - Early Nintendo products sometimes carried the name Nintendo (\u4efb\u5929\u5802) or the maker\u2019s name or seal; but there were many small makers and imitations in that period, so a mark isn\u2019t proof by itself.\n\n4. Packaging and labels\n   - Original boxes (if present) should match card age: paper stock, printing method, wear consistent with age.\n   - Beware of artificially aged boxes glued to newer cards.\n\n5. Wear, patina and signs of age\n   - Genuine century\u2011old cards show uneven wear, foxing, paper brittleness, insect damage, or repairs. Aging that is uniform across all surfaces or looks contrived (even discoloration, artificially browned edges) can indicate faking.\n   - Smell: very old paper has a characteristic musty/old paper smell; chemical or perfume smells can indicate tampering.\n\n6. Inks and pigments\n   - Some pigments/dyes were not available until later; bright modern synthetic dyes on an otherwise \u201cold\u201d card are a red flag.\n\n7. Provenance and documentation\n   - A clear chain of ownership, receipts, old inventory stamps, or cataloged auction history greatly increases credibility.\n\nRed flags (things that make a claim unlikely)\n- The seller offers a Western 52\u2011card deck branded Nintendo that claims 1890s origin.\n- Printing is uniformly modern offset/CMYK while the seller claims hand\u2011printed 19th\u2011century manufacture.\n- The deck is in improbably pristine condition without convincing provenance.\n- The \u201cantique\u201d shows identical wear across every card or obvious chemical/heat aging.\n\nWhat you should do next\n- Ask the seller for high\u2011resolution photos of: card fronts, backs, edges, box (inside/outside), any kanji or stamps, and closeups of the printing. Include a ruler for scale.\n- Request provenance: where and when were they acquired? Any old receipts/labels/auction records?\n- Compare to known reference images of antique hanafuda (search museum collections, auction archives, collector sites).\n- Get an expert appraisal if it might be valuable: contact an auction house with an Asian antiques department (Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s, Bonhams) or a specialist in Japanese playing cards/hanafuda. Japanese paper conservators or university East Asian collections can also help.\n- For a high\u2011value item, consider professional scientific testing (paper analysis or carbon dating) \u2014 note this can be destructive and costly.\n\nIf you want, send clear photos (front/back/edges/any kanji and the box) and I can give a more specific read on likely age and suspicious features.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states and uses the claim as fact: 'Nintendo was founded in 1889 as a hanafuda (Japanese playing\u2011card) maker.'
