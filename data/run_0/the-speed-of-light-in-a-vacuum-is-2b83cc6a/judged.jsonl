Definitions.\n- \"Scientific Constant\" means any numeric value commonly accepted in the physical sciences (e.g., speed of light, Planck\u2019s constant, gravitational constant) that is quoted, displayed, or used in calculations within the Services or Deliverables.\n- \"Authoritative Source\" means the most recent recommended values published by CODATA, NIST, or other internationally recognized standards bodies (as applicable to the specific constant), expressed in SI units unless the Parties agree otherwise.\n\n2. Standard of Accuracy.\n- Vendor warrants that, for all Scientific Constants included in Deliverables, Vendor will: (a) use the value from an Authoritative Source that is current as of the date of the Deliverable; and (b) express values in SI units unless otherwise agreed in writing.\n- Where a Scientific Constant is rounded for presentation, the rounded value must be produced by conventional rounding such that the reported value lies within the standard rounding interval (i.e., within +/- half of the unit in the last reported digit) of the Authoritative Source value. For any calculation used in training examples or outcomes, Vendor shall use the unrounded Authoritative Source value (or an appropriately precise value consistent with the Authoritative Source) even if a rounded number is shown in the illustrative text.\n\n3. Review and Certification.\n- Prior to delivery, Vendor will have all Scientific Constants and any dependent calculations reviewed by a qualified subject-matter expert (SME) and will provide Client, on request, a written statement identifying the Authoritative Sources used and certifying compliance with Section 2.\n\n4. Material Error; Notification; Remediation.\n- A \"Material Error\" in a Scientific Constant exists if (i) a value published in a Deliverable differs from the applicable Authoritative Source value by more than the allowable rounding interval described in Section 2; or (ii) a value (rounded or unrounded) is inaccurate in a way that a reasonable person in the intended audience would be likely to be materially misled in training conclusions, calculations, or decision-making.\n- Vendor shall notify Client in writing within five (5) business days after Vendor becomes aware of a Material Error (or within five (5) business days after receipt of Client\u2019s notice of a suspected Material Error).\n- Remediation. If a Material Error is confirmed, Vendor shall, at Vendor\u2019s expense and within the following timeframes: (a) correct and re-issue all digital Deliverables and provide corrected files to Client within ten (10) business days of confirmation; (b) for printed materials, notify recipients of the erratum and provide corrected replacements or reprints within thirty (30) calendar days of confirmation (or such longer period as reasonably necessary given printing and distribution logistics, but not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days absent Client\u2019s prior written consent); and (c) provide a written description of the error, the correction made, and steps taken to prevent recurrence.\n\n5. Remedies; Indemnity; Limitations.\n- Vendor will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against direct damages (including reasonable remediation costs and reasonable third\u2011party claims directly resulting from the Material Error) caused by Vendor\u2019s breach of this clause, subject to the indemnity cap and exclusions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any limitation of liability in this Agreement, Vendor\u2019s liability for claims arising from willful misconduct or gross negligence in connection with Scientific Constants shall not be limited.\n- The Parties agree to exclude liability for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising solely from an error in a Scientific Constant, except where such exclusion is prohibited by law or except to the extent such damages arise from Vendor\u2019s willful misconduct or gross negligence.\n\n6. Ongoing Updates.\n- For Deliverables that are to remain in use for a period longer than twelve (12) months, Vendor shall, upon Client\u2019s reasonable request, review and, if necessary, update Scientific Constants to reflect any new Authoritative Source releases and shall propose any material content updates to Client for approval.

For most intro tutoring, \"about 300,000 km/s\" is fine \u2014 but you should clarify that it's an approximation and give the exact SI value when precision matters.\n\nWhy:\n- The SI-defined exact value is c = 299,792,458 m/s, which is exactly 299,792.458 km/s. That exactness comes from the definition of the metre (since 1983).\n- Saying \"300,000 km/s\" is only a ~0.07% high bias (difference \u2248 207.5 km/s). For classroom back-of-envelope calculations and most high-school problems this error is negligible.\n- The potential problem is pedagogy: writing \"300,000 km/s\" (especially without \u2248 or scientific notation) can suggest an exact figure or give ambiguous significant figures. That can confuse students about precision and significant figures.\n\nPractical recommendation\n- If your materials are introductory/high-school level: keep the number but revise wording to make it explicit that it is an approximation and show a more precise form. For example:\n  - \"The speed of light is about 3.00 \u00d7 10^5 km/s (\u2248300,000 km/s).

Also accept more precise values such as 299,792 km/s or 299,792.458 km/s. If the question explicitly asks for the exact SI definition, require 299,792,458 m/s (which is the SI exact value).\n\nDetailed rationale for reviewers\n\n1) SI definition and unit conversion\n- The speed of light in vacuum is defined by the SI as exactly 299,792,458 m/s. Because 1 km = 1000 m exactly, that corresponds exactly to 299,792.458 km/s. Students commonly round that to 3.00\u00d710^5 km/s or 300,000 km/s for use in calculations and teaching examples. Accepting the rounded form therefore reflects a correct numerical representation of the same physical constant to a standard number of significant digits.\n\n2) Rounding and significant-figure conventions\n- 300,000 km/s is the standard rounded form used in many textbooks and introductory problems. It represents the speed of light to three significant figures (when understood as 3.00\u00d710^5 km/s) and is well within typical tolerances used in homework and exams. The difference between 300,000 km/s and the exact 299,792.458 km/s is ~208 km/s, a relative error of ~0.07%, which is negligible for virtually all classroom calculations.\n\n3) Pedagogical and practical considerations\n- Many exercises expect students to use an approximate value of c for order-of-magnitude or algebraic problems. Penalizing students for using the common rounded value would be inconsistent with typical physics instruction and could unfairly penalize correct reasoning. If the problem required very high precision or propagation of small numerical differences, the question should explicitly request more digits or the exact SI-definition value.\n\n4) Consistency and fairness\n- To be consistent and fair, the key should accept standard common notations and reasonable rounding. Examples of acceptable answers: 3\u00d710^5 km/s, 3.00\u00d710^5 km/s, 300,000 km/s, 2.9979\u00d710^5 km/s, 299,792 km/s, 299,792.458 km/s. If an answer is numerically far from the exact value (e.g., 250,000 km/s or 350,000 km/s), it should be marked incorrect.\n\nRecommended acceptance rule for the key (rubric language)\n- Mark as correct any answer that equals the defined value 299,792,458 m/s expressed in any common equivalent form, or any rounded form within 0.5% of that value (e.g., 300,000 km/s or 2.9979\u00d710^5 km/s). If the question explicitly requests the exact SI value, award full credit only for 299,792,458 m/s (or an equivalent exact expression).\n\nClosing note\n- If reviewers want stricter precision for particular assessment items, the test item should state that requirement explicitly (for example: \"Give the speed of light in vacuum to six significant figures\" or \"Give the exact SI-defined value\"). Without such a specification, accepting 300,000 km/s is both scientifically defensible and pedagogically appropriate.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly endorses accepting '300,000 km/s' as a correct rounded value, cites the exact SI value (299,792,458 m/s) and the converted km/s value, quantifies the relative error (~0.07%), and recommends accepting common rounded forms.
