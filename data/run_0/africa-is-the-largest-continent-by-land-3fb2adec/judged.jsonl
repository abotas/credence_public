Use an equal-area projection (or an interactive tool) to correct this visual error.\n- Another related confusion: \u201clargest by area\u201d vs \u201clargest by population.\u201d Asia is largest by both area and population, but Africa is second in area and is also rising fast in population, so clarify which \u201clargest\u201d you mean.\n\nQuick 10-minute mini-lesson plan\n- 1 min: Hook \u2014 ask students to guess largest continent.\n- 2 min: Reveal numbers for Asia and Africa; make the compact comparisons above.\n- 3\u20134 min: Visual demo \u2014 use an equal-area map or TheTrueSizeOf.com to drag the U.S., China, India, and Greenland onto Africa. If you have a projector, show Gall\u2013Peters or Mollweide projection to contrast with Mercator.\n- 2 min: Address misconception \u2014 explain why Mercator distorts sizes and clear up Greenland vs Africa, and the population vs area distinction.\n- 1\u20132 min: Exit ticket \u2014 one-sentence answer: \u201cWhy does Greenland look big on some maps?\u201d or \u201cName one country that could fit inside Africa.\u201d\n\nResources and tools\n- TheTrueSizeOf.com \u2014 drag-and-drop country outlines to compare real sizes\n- Google Earth \u2014 measure and overlay country outlines\n- Equal-area world maps: Gall\u2013Peters, Mollweide (printable versions useful)\n\nIf you want, I can write a short slide text or a printable worksheet/exit ticket based on this plan.
