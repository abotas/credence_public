Exact positive squares\n- For a floating implementation, perfect squares that are exactly representable (like 144.0) should give an exactly representable positive result. You can assert exact equality for these (or use a zero tolerance).\n  - e.g. assert sqrt(144.0) == 12.0\n\n2. General floating comparisons\n- For non\u2011perfect squares use a tolerance (relative or absolute) rather than direct equality:\n  - e.g. assert isclose(sqrt(2.0), 1.41421356237, rel=1e-15)\n\n3. Sign of zero (signed zeros)\n- IEEE\u2011754 has +0 and \u22120. Many libraries return +0 for +0 input and preserve the sign for \u22120 (implementation dependent). If your platform cares about signed zeros, test both:\n  - assert sqrt(+0.0) is +0.0 (and signbit is False)\n  - assert sqrt(-0.0) has the expected signbit (check docs) \u2014 use signbit or copysign to test.\n\n4. Negative reals (real sqrt)\n- If your sqrt is real-valued, negative inputs are domain errors/return NaN (or throw), so assert that explicitly:\n  - assert isnan(sqrt(-1.0))  or expect an exception (language specific)\n\n5. Complex principal square root (if your function supports complex)\n- The principal complex square root is defined with the branch cut on the negative real axis: for z = r e^{i\u03b8} with \u03b8 in (-\u03c0, \u03c0], sqrt(z) = sqrt(r) e^{i \u03b8/2}. Practical rule: principal sqrt has non\u2011negative real part; if real part is 0 then imaginary part is non\u2011negative.\n  - e.g. sqrt(-144) (complex) == 0 + 12i\n\n6. NaN handling\n- sqrt(NaN) should return NaN. Remember NaN != NaN, so assert via an isnan check.\n\n7. Infinities\n- sqrt(+\u221e) => +\u221e\n- sqrt(\u2212\u221e) => NaN (for real sqrt) or -> principal complex value (implementation dependent)\n\n8. Subnormals / very small or large inputs\n- Test subnormal inputs and very large inputs. IEEE sqrt is typically correctly rounded; you may want to check a few extremes if your library claims IEEE behavior.\n\n9. Integer/rounded sqrt APIs\n- If you have integer sqrt functions (e.g., integer floor sqrt, integer root, or functions that return integer types), document and test their specified behavior (floor, truncation, overflow, etc.). Don\u2019t conflate these with real principal sqrt.\n\nPractical test examples (pseudocode)\n- assert sqrt(144.0) == 12.0\n- assert isclose(sqrt(2.0), 1.4142135623730951, rel=1e-15)\n- assert isnan(sqrt(-1.0))   # real sqrt\n- assert isnan(sqrt(float('nan')))\n- assert sqrt(float('inf')) == float('inf')\n- assert signbit(sqrt(+0.0)) == False\n- if you expect sign preservation: assert signbit(sqrt(-0.0)) == True\n- For complex sqrt: assert cmath.sqrt(-144+0j) == 12j  (principal branch)\n\nSummary\n- Expect sqrt(144) to be +12 (or 12.0). Also add tests for NaN, \u00b10, \u00b1\u221e, negative inputs (real vs complex), and use tolerant comparisons for non-exact floats. If your target platform claims IEEE\u2011754 behavior, add tests for signed zero and correct handling of NaN/\u221e.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states 'the principal square root of 144 is +12.0' and says a test asserting sqrt(144) == 12 is correct, which clearly supports the proposition.

That means 144.0 and 12.0 have exact binary representations, and typical hardware/library sqrt implementations return the correctly rounded value, i.e. exactly 12.0.\n- If the input is the result of prior floating\u2011point arithmetic (e.g. 144.00000000000003 or 143.99999999999997), sqrt may produce a value slightly off 12 (12.000000000000001 or 11.999999999999998). Hardcoding 12 would then be wrong for those cases.\n- Different types: the same holds for float/double; for extended long double on some platforms behavior is still typically exact but platform differences exist.\n- Non\u2011IEEE or buggy math libraries / very unusual environments: there\u2019s a tiny chance of differences. Also compiler flags that change math semantics (fast\u2011math, fused ops, different rounding modes) can affect results.\n- Maintainability: special\u2011casing specific inputs in code can make it brittle and harder to understand. If you only need compile\u2011time constants, let the compiler constant\u2011fold (or use constexpr in C++). If you need a fast branch for exact perfect squares, consider an integer check (is n a perfect square?) or a small lookup table.\n\nPractical recommendations\n- If you mean the literal sqrt(144.0) in hot code, let the compiler fold it to 12.0 or make it a compile\u2011time constant instead of hand\u2011coding at many call sites.\n- If you\u2019re special\u2011casing because inputs might be integers known to be perfect squares, do the check in integer arithmetic (no rounding issues).\n- If you\u2019re worried about performance, measure. Modern sqrt is fast; special\u2011casing may not be worth the complexity.\n\nConclusion: Hardcoding \u201csqrt(144) = 12\u201d is safe for the exact literal 144 on usual platforms, but avoid hardcoding widely unless you control the inputs and platform \u2014 prefer compiler constant folding or integer checks for robustness.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states 'Mathematically sqrt(144) = 12' and affirms that for the literal 144.0 typical IEEE\u2011754 sqrt implementations return exactly 12.
