Ask about exclusions and special pests.\n   - Are dangerous species (brown recluse, black widow, etc.) treated under the same plan or are they a separate service/fee?\n4. Ask about guarantees.\n   - Do they guarantee spider control between visits? Is there a callback at no extra charge if spiders return?\n5.

Spiders are arachnids (class Arachnida), not insects (class Insecta).

Accuracy early on helps build correct long\u2011term mental models, but keep the first lessons simple and concrete so you don\u2019t overload or frustrate young children.\n\nWhy:\n- Long term: learning correct categories now makes later science easier. Misconceptions (e.g., \u201cspiders are insects\u201d) are common and can become persistent if unstated and repeated.\n- Short term: very young kids learn best with simple, observable features and hands\u2011on sorting. Too many technical terms at once increases cognitive load.\n\nPractical approach you can use\n- Preschool (3\u20135): focus on observable differences. Play sorting games: \u201ccreatures with 6 legs\u201d vs \u201ccreatures with 8 legs,\u201d or \u201cinsects vs not insects\u201d as a simple working label. Use lots of pictures and real-life encounters.\n- Early elementary (5\u20138): introduce the words insect and arachnid and the key features that distinguish them (insects: 6 legs, 3 body parts, usually antennae and wings; arachnids: 8 legs, 2 body parts, no antennae). Use matching activities and simple experiments (count legs on toy animals, draw body segments).\n- Later elementary and up: refine categories (both are arthropods, talk about spiders, scorpions, mites as arachnids), cover exceptions and why scientists group animals by shared characteristics.\n\nTips to avoid cementing misconceptions\n- Emphasize features and reasoning, not just labels: \u201cWe group animals by things they have in common\u2014let\u2019s count legs and look at body parts.\u201d\n- Use progressive vocabulary: model the correct term (\u201cspider\u201d \u2192 \u201cthat\u2019s an arachnid\u201d) even if you let kids use simpler words at first.\n- Correct gently and explicitly: when a child calls a spider an insect, say something like, \u201cGood observation \u2014 spiders are not insects. They\u2019re called arachnids because they have 8 legs and 2 body parts.\u201d\n- Revisit and build complexity over time. Conceptual change is easier when children are given multiple, concrete examples across contexts.\n\nIf you must pick a curriculum\n- For preschool/kindergarten, a curriculum that simplifies classification but keeps the door open to refinement is fine.\n- For programs aiming at K\u20135 standards or long\u2011term science literacy, choose the curriculum that teaches the arachnid/insect distinction and gives tools (sorting, counting, features) for children to learn it.\n\nBottom line: accurate classification taught in a scaffolded, age\u2011appropriate way will serve your kids better over time.

The cleanest educational choice is to use a separate arachnid category (or a larger \u201carthropod\u201d category), but practical/gameplay factors might justify a deliberate simplification if you label it as such.\n\nWhy:\n- Biological accuracy: spiders are arachnids, not insects. If your game is marketed as educational/accurate, putting them in \u201cinsects\u201d undermines credibility and invites correction from teachers/parents.\n- Artistic work: your artist already prepared an arachnid deck \u2014 that\u2019s sunk creative effort and likely faster/cheaper to keep.\n- Player confusion: having both an \u201cinsect\u201d deck that contains spiders and an \u201carachnid\u201d deck (or artwork suggesting it) would confuse players. Consistency matters.\n\nWhen you might choose to put spiders in \u201cinsects\u201d anyway:\n- Target audience is very young and you deliberately simplify taxonomy for playability. In that case, be explicit about the simplification in the rulebook/box (\u201cWe group some bug-like creatures together for simpler play\u201d).\n- Playtesting showed balance or fun strictly depends on that grouping and you can\u2019t redesign gameplay in time.\n\nPractical compromise options\n- Keep a separate Arachnid deck (recommended for accuracy).\n- Combine insects + arachnids into one \u201cArthropods\u201d or \u201cBugs\u201d deck if you want fewer decks but remain accurate (and explain the category name).\n- Keep insect deck but add an \u201cArachnid\u201d icon/tag on spider cards and include a one-sentence educational note explaining the distinction\u2014this preserves play balance while teaching players.\n\nImmediate next steps (you paid deposit \u2014 act fast)\n1. Decide based on your goals: accuracy vs simplicity vs play balance. If unsure, default to accuracy unless you have a strong gameplay reason.\n2. Contact your printer now:\n   - Ask: has production started? Is there a final-file cutoff? What are change fees/timing?\n   - If production hasn\u2019t started, send updated files (rulebook + card art/layout). Request a new PDF proof.\n3. Talk to your artist:\n   - If you keep arachnids, confirm finished art is print-ready and update any card backs/rules.\n   - If you merge decks, ask about retouching/relabelling and timing/cost.\n4. Update packaging and copy: box face, rulebook, marketing text, and any educational claims.\n5. Do a quick round of focused playtesting if the change affects balance.\n\nWhat to tell the printer (sample quick message)\n- \u201cHi \u2014 deposit paid for project X. Has production begun? If not, we need to update final files: spiders should be in a separate \u2018arachnid\u2019 deck (or: we are merging into \u2018Arthropods\u2019). What are cutoff dates and any additional fees for file changes? Please confirm timeline for new proof.\u201d\n\nWhat to tell the artist (sample)\n- \u201cThanks for the arachnid deck art \u2014 we\u2019ve decided to keep spiders in a separate \u2018arachnid\u2019 deck for accuracy.

Both are arthropods but different groups.\n- Key differences: spiders have 8 legs and two body segments (cephalothorax + abdomen) and no antennae; insects have 6 legs, three body segments (head + thorax + abdomen), and antennae (many have wings).\n- Other differences: respiration and development differ (e.g., book lungs/tracheae in arachnids vs a tracheal system and metamorphosis patterns in insects).\n\nHow to handle it in class (options):\n- Public, brief correction (if you want the whole audience to hear): \u201cQuick note \u2014 spiders aren\u2019t insects; they\u2019re arachnids.
