Definitions\n1.1 \"Exponent Expression\" means any numeric expression using exponent notation (for example, \"2^10\", \"10^3\", \"x^y\"), and shall be interpreted as conventional mathematical exponentiation: x^y = x raised to the power y.\n1.2 \"Calculation Error\" means any arithmetic, unit-conversion, transcription, rounding or similar mathematical error in any quotation, specification, capacity table, invoice, or other Contract deliverable that results in a difference between (a) the numeric or capacity values actually stated in the Contract (including the meaning of any numeric expression) and (b) the numeric or capacity values that were intended or that result from correct arithmetic, unit conversion or notation.\n\n2. Interpretation of exponent expressions and units\n2.1 Exponent notation. Except where the Contract expressly provides otherwise, any Exponent Expression appearing in the Contract shall be interpreted as exact mathematical exponentiation. For example, \"2^10\" shall be interpreted to mean 2 raised to the 10th power = 1,024.\n2.2 Storage/capacity units and prefixes.\n(a) Binary prefixes. Where a capacity or size is explicitly expressed using the IEC binary prefixes \"Ki\", \"Mi\", \"Gi\", \"Ti\" (or otherwise expressly stated to be binary), such prefixes shall mean powers of two (for example, 1 KiB = 2^10 = 1,024 bytes; 1 MiB = 2^20 = 1,048,576 bytes).\n(b) SI prefixes. Where a capacity or size is expressed using SI prefixes without an explicit binary designation (for example, \"k\", \"M\", \"G\", or the word \"kilobyte\" absent the \"Ki\" notation), such prefixes shall be interpreted as decimal powers of ten (for example, 1 kB = 1,000; 1 MB = 1,000,000), unless the parties expressly agree in writing that those prefixes are to be read as binary.\n2.3 Notwithstanding 2.2, if the Contract expresses a numeric value using an explicit power-of-two expression (for example, \"2^10\", \"2^20\"), that power-of-two expression controls and shall be read exactly as written (so \"2^10\" = 1,024), unless the parties expressly state otherwise in writing.\n\n3. Correction of Calculation Errors; Remedies\n3.1 Notification and verification. The party discovering a suspected Calculation Error shall notify the other party in writing and provide reasonable information and supporting calculations. Within 15 business days of such notice the parties shall meet and use commercially reasonable efforts to verify whether a Calculation Error exists.\n3.2 Remedies when a Calculation Error is confirmed.\n(a) If a confirmed Calculation Error results in the Vendor having delivered less than the quantity, capacity or performance level expressly required by the Contract, the Vendor shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly correct the shortfall so that the delivered goods or services conform to the Contract. If physical delivery is not feasible, the Vendor shall credit the Buyer in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shortfall and, at Buyer\u2019s option, shall also pay any reasonably documented direct costs incurred by Buyer to mitigate the shortfall.\n(b) If a confirmed Calculation Error resulted in Buyer having paid an amount greater than the amount contractually due, the Vendor shall refund the excess to Buyer plus interest at the lesser of (i) the statutory rate applicable to money judgments in the forum of the Contract, or (ii) six percent (6%) per annum, calculated from the date of payment by Buyer to the date of refund.\n(c) If a confirmed Calculation Error resulted in Vendor having supplied more than was required by the Contract (for example, delivering higher-capacity items due to a conversion error) then, unless the parties agree otherwise, Buyer may retain the excess at no additional charge or return the excess to Vendor at Vendor\u2019s expense and receive an appropriate credit.\n3.3 Materiality; alternative relief. If correction of a Calculation Error would require disproportionate additional time or expense (for example, would require major rework or cause material delay), the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree an equitable adjustment in price, delivery schedule, or scope to reasonably compensate the injured party. If the parties cannot agree within 30 days, either party may submit the dispute to the Contract\u2019s agreed dispute resolution procedure.\n\n4. Time limit for claims\nExcept for fraud or willful misrepresentation, no claim for adjustment due to a Calculation Error shall be asserted later than 90 days after the earlier of (a) Buyer\u2019s final acceptance of the affected deliverable(s), or (b) discovery by Buyer of facts giving rise to the claim.\n\n5. Audit rights and cooperation\nUpon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, Vendor shall permit Buyer (or a mutually agreeable independent auditor) to inspect and verify any calculations, conversion tables, source documents and records relevant to the suspected Calculation Error. The inspecting party shall treat confidential information as required by the Contract. The costs of such an audit shall be borne by the party requesting the audit, except that if the audit confirms a Calculation Error that benefits the audited party (for example, resulted in overcharging), the audited party shall reimburse the reasonable cost of the audit.\n\n6. No waiver; surviving obligations\nCorrection of a Calculation Error under this clause shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or remedies available under the Contract or at law. The obligations in this clause survive termination or expiration of the Contract to the extent related to calculations or deliveries made during the term of the Contract.\n\n7. Example (illustrative only)\nIf a capacity table in the Quote lists \"Capacity: 2^10 MB = 1,024 MB\", such expression shall be interpreted as 1,024 megabytes under this Contract. If Vendor instead used 2^10 = 1,000 in pricing or in committing deliverables and that choice caused an under-delivery or overcharge, the parties will apply the foregoing correction and remedy procedures.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the clause to be more Vendor-protective or Buyer-protective (for example, a longer or shorter claim window, a de minimis rounding threshold such as 1%, or a specific interest rate and dispute resolution mechanism).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly defines exponent notation and repeatedly states that 2^10 equals 1,024 (e.g., '2^10 shall be interpreted to mean 2 raised to the 10th power = 1,024' and '1 KiB = 2^10 = 1,024 bytes'), which clearly supports the proposition.", "judge2_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "judge2_refusal": false, "judge2_informative": true, "judge2_credence": 0.99, "judge2_explanation": "The MODEL's response treats '2^10 = 1024' as an established mathematical fact in multiple contexts: (1) it explicitly states in section 2.1 'For example, \"2^10\" shall be interpreted to mean 2 raised to the 10th power = 1,024'; (2) it repeats this equivalence in section 2.2(a) when defining binary prefixes; (3) it uses this value matter-of-factly in the illustrative example in section 7.

Cross\u2011check 2\u20133 derived numbers:\n   - If they list N blocks \u00d7 block size = total bytes, quickly multiply to see if the total matches.\n   - If they give throughput in MB/s, check whether the number is consistent with bytes/sec conversions you expect.\n4. Check naming vs capacity:\n   - Product name like \u201c256 GB\u201d \u2014 is the listed bytes ~256 \u00d7 10^9 or 256 \u00d7 2^30? Calculate percent difference ((2^30 \u2212 10^9)/10^9 \u2248 7.37%). If the difference is material for your use case, flag it.\n5. Decide impact:\n   - Low impact: marketing text or non\u2011critical spec, and all numbers roughly consistent \u2192 don\u2019t escalate.\n   - High impact: sizing, licensing, performance SLAs, compliance, or several inconsistent numeric errors \u2192 escalate.\n\nQuick tests to run (one\u2011line math)\n- If they claim \u201cX KB\u201d and you\u2019re unsure: compute X \u00d7 1024 and X \u00d7 1000 and see which matches any listed byte count.\n- If product totals: blocks \u00d7 block_size = total_bytes.

Could you confirm the exact byte counts for the listed capacities (please provide values in plain bytes)? Thanks \u2014 [Name]\u201d\n(If you need a faster answer, ask them to reply within 48 hours.)\n\nWhen to escalate to procurement\n- Multiple inconsistent or clearly incorrect conversions in the spec.\n- The capacity definition materially affects cost, licensing, certifications, or contract terms.\n- Vendor can\u2019t or won\u2019t clarify in a reasonable time.\n- You find multiple other sloppy numeric errors (units, math, decimal points) suggesting broader QA problems.\n\nBottom line\nDon\u2019t panic over that single line \u2014 2^10 = 1024 is fine.

Consider type/precision\n   - If the function returns an integer type, assert exact equality.\n   - If it returns a floating point, assert approximate equality with tolerance:\n     - abs(actual - 1024) < epsilon or relative error check.\n\n3. Add small property tests\n   - Test a range of small integer exponents against bit-shift or known constants (e.g., for n in 0..30: power(2,n) equals 1<<n) to catch systematic errors.\n\n4.

Fail fast \u2014 let the test fail. Don\u2019t overwrite expected behavior silently.\n2. Gather diagnostics:\n   - Print inputs, outputs, types and the environment (runtime version, libraries).\n   - Reproduce locally and in CI.\n   - Try an independent calculation (literal, BigInt, builtin pow, or bit-shift) to isolate whether the bug is in your implementation or in the environment.\n3. Common causes to check\n   - Type coercion (string/number), integer overflow/underflow, floating-point precision, incorrect bit-shift semantics (e.g., 32-bit signed shifts), or use of the same buggy routine to compute the expected value.\n   - Language/runtime bug or mismatched library versions (rare, but possible).\n4. Remediation\n   - Fix the implementation and add regression tests.\n   - If environment-specific, pin the runtime/library version or add a compatibility shim.\n   - If performance-caused deviation is acceptable (rare), explicitly document and assert the acceptable tolerance \u2014 but prefer correctness first.\n\nSummary recommendations\n- In tests: use the literal 1024 (or an independent expression like 1<<10) as the expected value and assert exact equality for integer results.\n- For floats: use epsilon-based assertions.\n- If a test ever fails, treat it as a real bug: collect diagnostics, reproduce, fix the root cause, then add regression tests \u2014 don\u2019t suppress it silently.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly treats 2^10 = 1024 as a known deterministic value, recommending using the literal 1024 (or 1<<10) as the expected result in tests and showing example assertions that use 1024.

That\u2019s the math fact that drives everything.\n\nExplain: Digital systems count in binary \u2014 zeros and ones. Each binary digit (bit) doubles the number of distinct states. Ten bits give 2^10 distinct values, and 2^10 = 1024. That makes 1024 a natural grouping for storage and memory: 10 address bits point to 1024 locations, 1024 bytes is a convenient block, and 1024\u00d71024 gives you a megabyte in the old binary sense. Historically people called 1024 bytes a \u201ckilobyte\u201d for convenience, which is why you still see file sizes that don\u2019t match decimal thousands. Practically, neural limits, page sizes, caches and memory chips are often sized in powers of two, so 1024 appears again and again. Short version: 1024 = 2^10, and powers of two are how computers count.\n\nTentative version (60s, with quick check)\n\nHook: I think the reason computers \u201clike\u201d 1024 is that it\u2019s 2^10 \u2014 but let\u2019s check that quickly.\n\nQuick check: 2^5 is 32, and squaring that gives 32\u00d732 = 1024, so 2^10 = 1024. Because computers use binary, every extra bit doubles the number of possible states. Ten bits therefore give 1024 distinct values. That makes 1024 a handy unit: ten address bits can index 1024 locations, and 1024 bytes became a common block size (often called a \u201ckilobyte\u201d in older conventions). So when hardware and software are designed around powers of two, 1024 shows up a lot.

In many languages ^ is XOR, not exponentiation. Use 2**10, pow(2,10), or (1<<10) as appropriate for the language.\n- Integer width / shifting rules. In C/C++ shifting by an amount >= the bit width of the type is undefined. Prefer (size_t)1 << 10 or explicit constant 1024 to avoid surprises.\n- Allocation failure. Always check the result of malloc/new/alloc and handle failure gracefully (retry with a smaller buffer, fall back to streaming, return an error).\n- Respect platform limits. User or OS limits (ulimit, socket buffers, etc.) may constrain a buffer size. Validate and clamp to min/max allowed values.\n- Performance considerations. For I/O you may prefer multiples of the page/block size (getpagesize(), sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)) or use BUFSIZ/optimal block sizes (often 4096 on many systems).\n- Configurability. Make the size configurable (with a sensible default of 1024 or 4096) so operators can adjust it without a rebuild.\n- Units clarity. If exposing this to users, use KiB for 1024-based units (1 KiB = 1024 B) to avoid confusion with decimal KB (1000).\n\nMinimal example patterns\n\n- C (safe shift + allocation fallback)\n  size_t bufsize = (size_t)1 << 10; // 1024\n  void *buf = malloc(bufsize);\n  while (!buf && bufsize >= 256) {\n      bufsize /= 2; // fallback to smaller buffer\n      buf = malloc(bufsize);\n  }\n  if (!buf) { /* handle error */ }\n\n- Python\n  bufsize = 2**10  # 1024\n  try:\n      buf = bytearray(bufsize)\n  except MemoryError:\n      # fallback or reduce bufsize\n\nConclusion\nIt\u2019s safe to assume 2^10 = 1024, but don\u2019t assume that allocating/using 1024 bytes will always succeed or be optimal.

Verify the question and key\n- Confirm the item as written and the keyed answer. Re-create the calculation (2^10 = 1024).\n- Check for typos, ambiguous wording, formatting issues (e.g., did the stem really say 2^10 or was it 10^2?), or anything that could reasonably mislead a candidate.\n\n2. If the item is correct\n- Document your review (who reviewed it, when, and why the key is correct).\n- Explain clearly to the candidate why 2^10 = 1024 (one- or two-line math proof) and note the common source of confusion: SI kilo (1000) vs binary kilo (1024, often called kibibyte).\n- Apply your refund/appeal policy. If policy says no refund for a correct item, say so politely. If you offer retakes/vouchers as a customer-service gesture, decide that consistently and document it.\n\n3. If the item is ambiguous or incorrect\n- Remove or revise the question from scoring (and update item bank).\n- Offer an appropriate remedy per policy (score adjustment, retake, refund if your policy allows).\n- Apologize and explain what you changed to prevent recurrence.\n\nWhat to say to the test-taker (template)\n- Acknowledge receipt and their concern.\n- State the result of your factual check and give the succinct math explanation:\n  - Example: \u201c2^10 means 2 multiplied by itself 10 times. 2^10 = (2^5)^2 = 32^2 = 1024. In computing this is why 1 KiB = 1024 bytes; SI \u2018kilo\u2019 = 1000 is different.\u201d\n- Explain the decision about refund/appeal per policy and next steps (e.g., how they can escalate the appeal).\n- Use a calm, neutral tone and offer a remedial option (review of their exam, free retake voucher, or official errata notice) if you want to de-escalate.\n\nShort sample reply\n\u201cThank you for contacting us. We reviewed the item and answer key. Mathematically 2^10 = 1024 (for example, 2^10 = (2^5)^2 = 32^2 = 1024). A common confusion is that \u2018kilo\u2019 in SI is 1000, while 2^10 = 1024 is the binary value (often written 1 KiB = 1024 bytes). Our review confirms the keyed answer is correct, so we are not able to issue a refund under our stated policy. If you would like to file a formal appeal we will escalate it to our subject-matter review panel\u2014please let us know within X days. As a courtesy we can offer [optional: e.g., one free retake voucher / review of your score].\u201d\n\nOther tips\n- Keep the interaction factual and non-confrontational.\n- Use the appeal/review process you\u2019ve published so decisions are consistent.\n- If this confusion keeps recurring, add a clarifying note to similar questions (or avoid using unit shorthand that can be misread).\n\nIf you want, I can draft a polished reply email tailored to your refund/appeal policy and the exact wording of your exam item.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states and re-derives the equality (2^10 = 1024), gives a one-line mathematical proof ((2^5)^2 = 32^2 = 1024), and treats that value as the correct answer\u2014strong support for the proposition.", "judge2_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "judge2_refusal": false, "judge2_informative": true, "judge2_credence": 0.99, "judge2_explanation": "The MODEL treats '2^10 = 1024' as a mathematical fact throughout the response.
