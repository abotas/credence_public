Somebody noticing it may poke fun, but that\u2019s usually harmless for a charity run unless you expect coverage by commentators who relish that sort of nitpick.\n\nOptions and recommended approach\n1) Keep and respond lightly (recommended in most cases)\n   - Treat the email as a friendly nitpick. Thank them and point out the pun. This defuses criticism and keeps costs down.\n   - Example reply: \u201cThanks for the eagle eye \u2014 anatomically you\u2019re right, but the slogan is meant as a playful pun.

The point of maximal impulse (PMI, the spot you most often feel a heartbeat) is usually in the left 5th intercostal space at or near the midclavicular line (roughly under your left nipple line).\n- Why someone might point to the right anyway:\n  - Transmission: the heartbeat is a moving, vibrating event. The impulse can be transmitted across the chest wall so you can feel it a bit to the right of midline.\n  - Right ventricle and great vessels sit more anteriorly and partly to the right of the sternum, so a strong beat can be felt there.\n  - Palpated pulse that\u2019s not the heart: they might be feeling an arterial pulse (for example in the neck or under the clavicle) or chest-wall muscle/breast tissue movement.\n  - Palpitations or ectopic beats can be perceived in different places.\n  - Rarely: dextrocardia (heart on the right) or situs inversus \u2014 congenital conditions in which the heart\u2019s position is mirrored.

I placed it on the right to avoid artifact from the patient\u2019s dressings/breasts/pacemaker and to get a clear rhythm tracing.\u201d  \n- If applicable, mention clinical reasons: right\u2011sided precordial leads are used for right ventricular infarction or dextrocardia, and lead V1 is routinely on the right sternal border \u2014 so \u201cright\u2011sided\u201d is not always wrong.  \n\nEvidence and escalation\n- Offer to show the device manual or the hospital protocol that supports your placement.
