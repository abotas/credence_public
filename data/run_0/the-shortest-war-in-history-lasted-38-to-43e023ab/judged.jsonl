Draft clause (drop-in style)\n1. Definitions.\n- \u201cPromotion Materials\u201d means any materials used by Speaker to promote Speaker\u2019s participation in the Event (including slide decks, bios, social media posts, email copy, videos, images, taglines).\n- \u201cPresentation Materials\u201d means slides, handouts, scripts, workshop materials, and any content Speaker will present at the Event.\n\n2. Accuracy; Sources; Representations.\n- Speaker represents and warrants that all factual statements in the Promotion Materials and Presentation Materials will be true and accurate to the best of Speaker\u2019s knowledge, and that Speaker will exercise commercially reasonable care to verify any factual assertions, statistics, historical claims or third\u2011party quotations prior to use.\n- Upon Organizer\u2019s request, Speaker will promptly provide citations or source documentation supporting any factual claim contained in Promotion Materials or Presentation Materials.\n\n3. Delivery; Pre-approval.\n- Speaker will deliver Promotion Materials to Organizer for review no later than [14] days prior to the date of publication and will deliver Presentation Materials no later than [7] days prior to the Event (or earlier if requested by Organizer).\n- Organizer has the right to review and reasonably withhold approval of any Promotion Materials and Presentation Materials that, in Organizer\u2019s reasonable discretion, contain material inaccuracies, misleading statements, defamatory content, or content that could reasonably be expected to materially harm Organizer\u2019s reputation or brand. Speaker will promptly make requested edits or withdraw the content.\n\n4. Corrections and Remediation.\n- If Organizer or a third party notifies Speaker or Organizer of an inaccuracy in any Promotion Materials or Presentation Materials, Speaker will, within [48] hours: (a) correct the inaccurate content in all digital Promotion Materials and Presentation Materials under Speaker\u2019s control; (b) notify Organizer of the correction; and (c) reasonably cooperate with Organizer to publish a corrective notice, retraction or clarification (in the form reasonably requested by Organizer) in channels where the inaccurate content appeared.\n- If Organizer reasonably determines that the inaccuracy presents a material reputational risk, Organizer may require immediate removal of the relevant Promotion Materials and may withhold further promotion until corrected.\n\n5. Indemnity; No Endorsement.\n- Speaker will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Organizer and its officers, employees and agents from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of or resulting from Speaker\u2019s breach of the warranties in Section 2, including knowingly false or defamatory statements in Promotion Materials or Presentation Materials.\n- Speaker acknowledges that any references in Promotion Materials or Presentation Materials to Organizer\u2019s products, services or policies are Speaker\u2019s own statements and do not constitute endorsement or representation by Organizer, unless expressly agreed in writing.\n\n6. Remedies; Termination.\n- Material breach of Sections 2\u20134 is a material breach of this Agreement and entitles Organizer to (in addition to any other remedies) require removal or modification of the offending materials, suspend promotion, and, if the breach is not cured within [7] days after notice, terminate this Agreement for cause.\n\n7.

If you want stronger protection, increase pre-approval timeframes and reduce cure periods.)\n\nB. Advice re: the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War claim and whether to insist removal/softening\n\nShort answer: Don\u2019t necessarily insist on removal \u2014 the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War is commonly reported to have lasted roughly 38\u201345 minutes \u2014 but require citation and either (a) soften the wording to avoid absolutist phrasing or (b) include an attribution. Also require pre-approval of promotional copy and a right to require correction/removal.\n\nRationale and practical steps:\n- Accuracy: The claim that the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War lasted 38\u201345 minutes is a widely cited historical fact in many mainstream sources. It is unlikely to expose you to legal liability (it\u2019s not a defamatory statement about a living person), but any factual error in promotional material can create reputational risk for your company if attendees or media call it out.\n- Reputational risk: Even if accurate, absolute-sounding claims can be mocked or fact-checked publicly. If the speaker uses similar unqualified claims elsewhere (especially about sensitive topics), that raises more risk.\n- Best practice: Ask the speaker to provide a source (e.g., Britannica, Oxford Reference, primary historical sources) for the 38\u201345 minute figure. Preferably use softer phrasing or attribution: examples below.\n\nSuggested softened phrasings you can require instead of an absolute line:\n- \u201cThe Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War is commonly reported to have lasted about 38\u201345 minutes.\u201d\n- \u201cOften cited as the shortest war in history (around 38\u201345 minutes).\u201d\n- \u201cReported duration: approximately 38\u201345 minutes (sources: [cite]).\u201d\n\nOperational recommendations\n- Require the speaker to submit the promo deck for approval per the clause above.\n- Require a \u201csources\u201d slide or appendix for any striking factual assertions.\n- If the speaker refuses to soften or provide sources and you believe the claim could draw negative attention, reserve the right to ask for removal of that specific line from promotions while permitting it (or a qualified version) in the live talk with a citation.\n- Keep communications documented: approval/rejection and any required edits should be in writing.\n\nIf you want stronger legal protection\n- Add a broader indemnity for claims arising from false statements in the presentation (already included above).\n- Have your legal counsel review the final clause and the speaker\u2019s contract language for enforceability under your jurisdiction.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Customize the clause for a particular governing law or corporate policy,\n- Draft example promotional copy with softened wording and citations, or\n- Provide a short checklist to use when reviewing speaker promo decks.\n\nWould you like the clause tailored to a specific jurisdiction or to include a stronger indemnity/insurance requirement?", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.95, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War is 'commonly reported to have lasted roughly 38\u201345 minutes' and advises not to insist on removal, only to require citation or soften the claim.

Different choices give figures from roughly 38 minutes up to around 45 minutes (or similar rounding).\n- \u201cWar\u201d here is also a specific, one-sided, short engagement: it was a bombardment and quick collapse, not a protracted campaign. If you broaden \u201cwar\u201d to include small skirmishes, police actions, or isolated clashes, other incidents could be shorter.\n\nHow to state it reliably\n- If you want to repeat it without sounding sloppy: \u201cThe Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War of 1896 is widely regarded as the shortest war in history \u2014 commonly said to have lasted about 38\u201345 minutes (the exact figure depends on how you define start and end).\u201d\n- If you want to be blunt with your brother, calling the precise \u201c38 minutes\u201d figure a simplification rather than a precise scientific measurement is fair.\n\nSo: don\u2019t call the whole claim bogus \u2014 it\u2019s a reliable shorthand \u2014 but do point out the measurement caveats if you want to be precise.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.95, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly endorses the claim as 'basically true' and cites common sources (Guinness, popular histories) and the typical ~38-minute timing, while acknowledging minor variation (up to ~45 minutes) depending on start/end definitions.

Corroborate with a secondary academic source\n   - Find a history book or journal article that discusses the event (university press or reputable historian) to confirm context and duration.\n4. Note timekeeping issues\n   - Confirm the times are local Zanzibar time and understand that contemporary reports sometimes rounded times; many sources give \u201cabout 38 minutes\u201d or \u201cabout 45 minutes.\u201d\n5. Check for competing claimants\n   - Do a quick search for lists of \u201cshortest wars\u201d to see if any other event is claimed to be shorter and whether that claim depends on a different definition.\n\nPractical quick sources to consult\n- Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War.\n- Guinness World Records (if available) for \u201cshortest war.\u201d\n- A reputable history book or academic paper on late\u201119th century East Africa or British imperial actions.\n- Contemporary newspaper archives (The Times, local colonial papers) or summaries citing Admiralty dispatches.\n- If you need something fast: Wikipedia\u2019s page is usually accurate on this point but use it only as a pointer to primary/secondary sources cited there.\n\nHow to phrase the opener (less risky)\n- Strong but safe: \u201cOften cited as the shortest war in history, the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War in 1896 lasted only about 38\u201345 minutes.\u201d\n- Safer/hedged: \u201cThe Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War of 1896 is commonly reported as the shortest war\u2014lasting roughly 40 minutes, depending on how you count it.\u201d\n- If you want to be catchy but cautious: \u201cDid you know one war reportedly lasted less than an hour? The Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War of 1896 is usually said to have lasted around 38\u201345 minutes.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re live and get challenged\n- Have a quick fallback: \u201cMost reference works call it the shortest \u2014 they give roughly 38\u201345 minutes \u2014 though that depends on how you define \u2018war.\u2019 I can send the sources after the show.\u201d\n\nBottom line\n- The claim is widely reported and unlikely to be flatly false, but small caveats exist.

But if you need to print that specific range without hedging, check a couple of primary/reputable sources first \u2014 here\u2019s what to look for and why.\n\nPrimary sources to check\n- Royal Navy ship\u2019s logs (ADM 53 series at The National Archives, Kew). Look up the logs for the vessels present off Zanzibar on 27 Aug 1896 (search for HMS Philomel and the other ships present). The logs give times for opening fire and for cessation/return of fire.\n- Admiralty and naval dispatches (Admiralty/Admiral\u2019s reports, ADM and possibly ADM 1). These are the official after-action reports that were sent to the Admiralty and often published subsequently.\n- The London Gazette (official British government notices). It published official dispatches and casualty reports from the action.\n- Foreign Office correspondence (FO series at The National Archives) for diplomatic timing and the ultimatum.\n- Contemporary newspapers (The Times (London), Illustrated London News, New York Times, etc.) \u2014 useful to cross-check reported times and the public record the day after the action.\nHow to find them quickly: use The National Archives\u2019 catalogue (Discovery) and search \u201cZanzibar 1896 Philomel\u201d or \u201cAnglo-Zanzibar War 1896\u201d; search The London Gazette online for \u201cZanzibar 1896\u201d or the relevant dates (late August/September 1896); search newspaper archives for 28\u201329 Aug 1896.\n\nReputable secondary sources to cite quickly\n- Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on the Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War (reputable, succinct, cites primary material).\n- Academic or reference histories of Zanzibar or late-Victorian naval operations \u2014 check the references in Wikipedia\u2019s \u201cAnglo\u2013Zanzibar War\u201d article and follow them to original sources (Wikipedia\u2019s refs often point to The London Gazette and period accounts).\n- Peer-reviewed journal articles or a standard academic history of East Africa/Zanzibar covering the 1890s (check university library catalogs).\n\nWhy sources give a range and how confident you can be\n- Different sources define the \u201cwar\u201d start/end differently: ultimatum expiry vs. when first shots were fired, and whether to count the mop-up/surrendering later that morning. That\u2019s why you see 38, 40, 38\u201345, or \u201caround 40 minutes.\u201d\n- The timing usually comes from British naval logs/dispatches and contemporary press reports \u2014 these are reliable for minute-level timings but may differ by a few minutes.\n- If you can cite The London Gazette or a ship\u2019s log entry that gives start and end times, confidence is high. If you can only rely on tertiary summaries (blogs) then confidence is low.\n\nPractical recommendation for your fact box\n- If you need a single sharp line and no time to check archives: \u201cShortest war in history: Anglo\u2013Zanzibar War, about 40 minutes (commonly quoted as 38\u201345 minutes).\u201d Add a parenthetical source such as \u201c(see Encyclopaedia Britannica; British Admiralty reports 1896).\u201d\n- If the editor wants the exact range printed as an asserted fact, verify one primary source (London Gazette dispatch or a ship\u2019s log) before running it.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Pull together the immediate accessible citations (Britannica, London Gazette issue number/date, a couple of newspaper reports) so you can quote them; or\n- Give step-by-step search terms and likely ship names/log file series to find the exact ADM entries at The National Archives.

Contemporary accounts and reputable reference works consistently report a very short engagement on 27 August 1896 \u2014 commonly quoted as about 38\u201345 minutes. Exact duration depends on how you define the start and end times (see below), so avoid an absolute single-minute claim unless you cite the source and definition you used.\n\nKey points and context\n- What happened: After the pro\u2011British sultanate\u2019s ruler died, Khalid bin Barghash seized the palace. The British consul favored another candidate (Hamoud). Britain issued an ultimatum ordering Khalid to step down. When the ultimatum expired, Royal Navy ships and a shore battery bombarded the palace and the Zanzibari armed yacht; Khalid\u2019s forces were quickly overwhelmed. Khalid fled and later surrendered; Hamoud was installed.\n- Common timeline used by sources:\n  - Ultimatum expiration/officially \u201cstart\u201d of hostilities: roughly 09:00 on 27 Aug 1896.\n  - Bombardment reported to have begun within minutes (some ship logs give times around 09:02).\n  - Major bombardment and resistance subsided within about 38 minutes; some accounts mark the end of significant fighting around 09:40.\n- Why you see two numbers (38 vs 45 minutes):\n  - Different sources use different start/end points (ultimatum expiry vs first shot; end of bombardment vs mop\u2011up/action at outlying positions).\n  - Some sources round or quote the time reported in a particular ship\u2019s log or a contemporary newspaper.\n\nReliability of sources\n- Good/reputable modern references that repeat the short duration:\n  - Encyclopaedia Britannica (summary entry)\n  - Oxford Reference entries\n  - BBC historical summaries/on this day features\n  - Guinness World Records (often cites \u201cshortest war\u201d and gives a 38\u2011minute figure)\n- Primary/contemporary sources: Admiralty and ship logs, official Royal Navy dispatches, and contemporary newspapers (e.g., The Times and New York Times coverage from late August 1896). These are the best places to pin down the minute\u2011by\u2011minute sequence.\n- Overall assessment: This is not an internet myth \u2014 it is based on contemporary reports and official records. The exact minute count is a matter of definition and source; reputable sources are consistent in reporting \u201cabout 40 minutes\u201d or \u201c38\u201345 minutes.\u201d\n\nCasualties and aftermath (brief)\n- Outcome: British victory; Khalid fled (to the German consulate), later went into exile; Hamoud installed with British backing.\n- Casualty figures vary by source. Contemporary and modern summaries report relatively heavy local casualties and damage to the palace and a few Zanzibari vessels; British casualties were minimal. If you need exact numbers for broadcast, verify the figure against the primary sources or cite the source you are using.\n\nRecommended on\u2011air wording\n- Prefer hedged phrasing that signals the small uncertainty, for example:\n  - \u201cThe Anglo\u2011Zanzibar War of 27 August 1896 \u2014 often called the shortest war in history \u2014 is commonly reported to have lasted roughly 38\u201345 minutes.\u201d\n  - Or: \u201cContemporary accounts and later reference works report that the fighting lasted only about 40 minutes (sources give figures from 38 to 45 minutes, depending on how the start and end times are defined).\u201d\n- Avoid an unqualified absolute like \u201cthe war lasted exactly 38 minutes\u201d unless you name the source (e.g., \u201caccording to [specific ship\u2019s log / Guinness World Records]\u201d).\n\nSuggested verification checklist before airing\n1. Pick the framing you want (exact minute vs rounded \u201cabout 40 minutes\u201d) and be consistent.\n2. If you will quote a specific minute (e.g., 38 minutes), cite the source (Guinness, a specific ship\u2019s log, or a named contemporaneous report).\n3. If you give casualty numbers, verify against Admiralty dispatches or a reputable secondary source and flag uncertainty if numbers vary.\n4.

Those are the primary sources you should consult to verify the claim.\n\nWhat to look for (primary-source categories and where they are held)\n- Royal Navy ship\u2019s logbooks (Admiralty logs). The vessels of the British Zanzibar station recorded the time firing began and when it ceased in their logbooks. These are held at The National Archives (Kew) in the ADM series (ADM 53 = ship\u2019s logs). Searching ADM 53 for the ships present at Zanzibar on 27 Aug 1896 will produce the relevant entries.  \n- Admiralty/Foreign Office dispatches and telegrams. Senior officers\u2019 despatches to the Admiralty and the British consul/agent\u2019s reports to the Foreign Office contain timelines and casualty reports; these are in the FO and ADM series at The National Archives. Parliamentary \u201cBlue Book\u201d papers (correspondence submitted to Parliament) also collected official telegrams/despatches and often published them.  \n- The London Gazette and Parliamentary Papers. Official despatches or summaries were often printed in Parliamentary Papers or referenced in The London Gazette; those publications sometimes give times and a short official narrative.  \n- Contemporary newspapers and correspondents\u2019 dispatches. The Times, The Daily Telegraph, New York Times and other papers of 28\u201329 August 1896 published contemporaneous accounts citing times (based on naval despatches and telegraph reports). These are primary-source contemporary reports (though not as authoritative as the original logs/official despatches).  \n- Zanzibari/Arab-language contemporaneous documents (less widely published). Local proclamations and eyewitness accounts exist but are scarcer in major archives; British records are the principal source for the minute-by-minute timing.\n\nWhy there\u2019s a 38\u201345 minute range\n- Different sources define the \u201clength\u201d differently: some measure from the expiry of the British ultimatum to the formal surrender/flag-lowering; others measure from the opening gun to cessation of fire; some round times or used local time versus British naval time. Slight differences in clock time reported in different ships\u2019 logs or telegrams produce the 38\u201345 minute window you see in secondary accounts.\n\nHow to verify the exact wording and timestamps\n1. Search The National Archives\u2019 Discovery catalogue for ADM 53 (ship logs) and FO/Admiralty correspondence for \u201cZanzibar 1896\u201d or the names of ships on station. Open the ADM 53 logbooks for 27 August 1896 and read the entries for the morning of the action \u2014 they should show times for \u201copened fire\u201d and \u201cceased firing\u201d or \u201csurrendered.\u201d  \n2. Locate the Admiralty/Foreign Office despatches in the FO/ADM series and the Parliamentary Papers/Blue Book for 1896 that collected official correspondence on the incident. Those documents will be the official British narrative and usually give precise times.  \n3.

For your fact\u2011checker cite the primary documents first, then well\u2011known secondary references that explicitly give the minute figure.\n\nKey sources to cite and where to find them\n\n1) Royal Navy despatches (primary)\n- Rear\u2011Admiral Harry Rawson\u2019s official despatch on the action at Zanzibar (published by the Admiralty / in official gazettes/newspapers shortly after 27 Aug 1896). This despatch records the times for the ultimatum and the opening/ending of fire. The despatch is the principal contemporary official source for the duration.\n\nHow to get it: search The London Gazette and the British Admiralty papers; the despatch is also reprinted in contemporary newspapers. If your publisher requires a page citation, request a scan from the London Gazette or a repro in The Times (28\u201329 Aug 1896).\n\n2) Ship logbooks (primary, definitive)\n- The minute\u2011by\u2011minute ship\u2019s logs for the British ships present (held at The National Archives, Kew, in the ADM 53 series). The logs (e.g., flagship entries) record exact times when guns were fired and when action ceased. These are the definitive primary evidence for the length of the engagement.\n\nHow to get them: order scans or copies from The National Archives catalogue (search ADM 53 + ship name + 1896 + Zanzibar). Cite the ADM 53 file(s) and the folio/date/entry when you quote times.\n\n3) Colonial Office / War Office correspondence (primary)\n- Colonial Office papers on the incident (The National Archives, CO series) include official British reporting on the events and may quote the despatch/log times. Useful for corroboration and for publishing context.\n\n4) Contemporary newspapers (secondary/primary corroboration)\n- The Times (London), The Morning Post, New York Times, etc., reported the affair within days and quoted official times or \u201cabout 40 minutes.\u201d Useful as contemporaneous corroboration and for quoting how it was reported at the time.\n\n5) Modern reference works (secondary, widely cited)\n- Guinness World Records \u2014 entry for \u201cShortest war\u201d (gives the 38 minutes figure). Useful as a mainstream, citable reference for a textbook.\n- Encyclopaedia Britannica \u2014 entry \u201cAnglo\u2011Zanzibar War\u201d (gives the ~40\u2011minute duration).\n- Standard histories and monographs on Zanzibar/British East Africa often note the duration (e.g., histories of Zanzibar or concise military histories). These can be used as supporting secondary sources.\n\nHow to present this to your fact\u2011checker\n- Primary citation example (recommended): Rawson, Rear\u2011Admiral H. C., Despatch concerning the action at Zanzibar, 27 August 1896. (published in The London Gazette / Admiralty records). Plus: ship\u2019s log, HMS [name], ADM 53, National Archives, 27 Aug 1896 (give the actual log reference once you pull the file).\n- Secondary citation example: Encyclopaedia Britannica, \u201cAnglo\u2011Zanzibar War,\u201d accessed [date]; Guinness World Records, \u201cShortest war in history,\u201d accessed [date].\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- look up and provide the precise London Gazette citation and exact ADM 53 log references (ship names and file numbers) you should quote, or\n- draft sample citations in whatever style your book uses (Chicago / MLA / APA).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly endorses the claim, stating that the 38\u201345 minute figure for the Anglo\u2011Zanzibar War is based on British primary sources (Royal Navy despatches and ship logbooks) and noting that modern references (Guinness, Britannica, military histories) rely on those sources.

That explains the 38 vs 45 minute variation.\n- Definition issues: opponents can argue it wasn\u2019t a \u201cwar\u201d but a short bombardment, a punitive action, or an internal power struggle with foreign intervention.
