Find primary/early documentary or archaeological evidence for Oxford\n   - Look for the earliest attested date of organized teaching in Oxford and early references (late 11th\u201312th century). Note college foundation dates if relevant.\n\n3. Find primary/early documentary or archaeological evidence for the Aztec polity\n   - Check the founding date of Tenochtitlan (1325) and the date scholars use for the formation of the Aztec/Tlacaelel-backed Triple Alliance (c.1428). Use both indigenous sources (codices) and modern syntheses.\n\n4. Compare dates and note caveats\n   - State the comparison and add a brief qualifier about which definitions you chose (e.g., \u201cUniversity teaching in Oxford attested c.1096 vs. Tenochtitlan 1325 / Triple Alliance c.1428 \u2014 so Oxford predates the Aztec Empire by centuries\u201d).\n\nSpecific kinds of sources to cite (and examples)\n- Institutional/official histories\n  - University of Oxford official history pages or FAQ (for the university\u2019s own dating claims).\n- Reputable encyclopedias and reference works\n  - Encyclopaedia Britannica articles: \u201cUniversity of Oxford\u201d and \u201cAztec\u201d or \u201cAztec Empire.\u201d\n- Scholarly secondary works (modern syntheses by historians/archaeologists)\n  - On Oxford: standard university histories or chapters in histories of medieval universities (look for titles by established historians of medieval education).\n  - On the Aztecs: works such as Ross Hassig, The Aztec Empire (1988); Michael E. Smith, The Aztecs (2003); or other recent scholarly overviews.\n- Primary or near-contemporary sources (for classroom nuance)\n  - For Oxford: medieval chronicles or documentary references to scholars/teaching in Oxford (as cited in university histories).\n  - For the Aztecs: indigenous sources (Florentine Codex, Codex Mendoza) and early Spanish chronicles (used with care).\n- Peer-reviewed articles and edited volumes\n  - Use journal articles or chapters that discuss dating and formation of the Triple Alliance or archaeological evidence for Tenochtitlan when you need precision.\n\nHow to cite succinctly on a slide\n- One line: \u201cOxford: teaching attested c.1096 (University of Oxford official history / Encyclopaedia Britannica).

So Oxford does predate the Aztec Empire by roughly 300+ years \u2014 the claim is factually defensible.\n- What to do: Verify with a source (e.g., University of Oxford history pages or Britannica for Oxford; Britannica or other academic sources for the Aztec Triple Alliance) and reword to be precise.\n\nSuggested precise phrasing (keep):\n- \"Teaching at the University of Oxford dates back to about 1096; the Aztec Triple Alliance was formed around 1428 \u2014 Oxford predates that empire by roughly 300 years.\"\n\nSafer alternatives (if you want to avoid cross-cultural comparisons that may read as insensitive):\n- Drop the comparison and state Oxford\u2019s age plainly: \"The University of Oxford has been teaching since about 1096.\"\n- Compare to a neutral/historical milestone instead: \"The University of Oxford predates the Magna Carta (1215) and Columbus's voyage to the Americas (1492).\"\n- If you must compare to the Aztecs, include dates and context: \"Oxford (c. 1096) predates the founding of the Aztec Triple Alliance (c. 1428).\"\n\nWhy this approach\n- Being explicit with dates reduces the risk of being challenged on accuracy.\n- Including context or choosing a less culturally loaded comparison prevents the implication that 'older = better' or that European institutions should be measured against non\u2011European polities, which can undermine credibility in DEI settings.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a slide text and a short speaker note that presents the fact accurately and sensitively.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the claim, saying 'The basic fact is correct' and 'factually defensible,' and cites dates (Oxford c.1096 vs Aztec Triple Alliance c.1428) showing Oxford predates the Aztec Empire by roughly 300 years, indicating very high confidence in the proposition.", "judge2_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "judge2_refusal": false, "judge2_informative": true, "judge2_credence": 0.92, "judge2_explanation": "The MODEL explicitly affirms the proposition as 'factually defensible' and provides specific supporting dates: Oxford teaching from ~1096 and the Aztec Empire from ~1428, establishing a ~300+ year gap.

The exact year is approximate.\n- \u201cAztec Empire\u201d refers specifically to the Triple Alliance (c. 1428). The Mexica/Aztec people and their city Tenochtitlan existed earlier (Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325), and broader Mesoamerican civilizations (e.g., Maya, Olmec) are far older \u2014 so don\u2019t say \u201cOxford is older than the Aztecs\u201d in a general sense.\n- Judges may nitpick wording, so use a precise phrasing such as: \u201cTeaching at Oxford is recorded from about 1096, which is roughly 330 years before the Aztec Triple Alliance (the Aztec Empire) was established around 1428.\u201d\n\nSources you can cite\n- Encyclopaedia Britannica, entry \u201cUniversity of Oxford\u201d (notes of teaching from 1096).\n- Encyclopaedia Britannica, entry \u201cAztec Empire\u201d (dates c. 1428\u20131521).\n- University of Oxford \u2014 official history/brief history pages (notes on early teaching).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can draft a one- or two-sentence line your student can use that includes the necessary qualifiers.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.95, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the proposition: it states 'Yes' and gives supporting dates (teaching at Oxford attested ~1096 vs Aztec Triple Alliance c. 1428), concluding Oxford precedes the Aztec Empire by ~330 years.

The factual claim is low-risk if phrased precisely; the reputational/cultural risk is moderate and depends on audience and tone.\n\nFacts to base a claim on\n- University of Oxford: commonly cited as teaching since about 1096 with a distinct university community by the 12th century.\n- Aztec Empire (the Triple Alliance): generally dated to 1428 CE (the Mexica/Aztec polity rose in the 14th\u201315th centuries).\nSo Oxford as an institution of higher learning is indeed older than the Aztec Empire.\n\nWhy your colleague\u2019s concern is valid\n- Sensitivity: comparing a European university to an indigenous empire can read as Eurocentric or dismissive of non\u2011European histories if framed casually.\n- Precision matters: vague statements (\u201colder than the Aztecs\u201d) can be challenged on technical grounds (the Mexica people and earlier Mesoamerican civilizations predate Oxford by centuries).\n- Audience reaction: some audiences will find the comparison clever; others (especially international or Indigenous audiences) may find it tone-deaf.\n\nWhat I recommend\n1. Prefer accuracy and context.

Avoid language that implies superiority of cultures. Keep the emphasis on longevity rather than \u201cbeating\u201d other societies.\n3. Test it. Run the line by a diverse internal group or PR/communications team and, if relevant, a cultural-sensitivity reviewer.\n4. If you want a less comparative angle, highlight Oxford\u2019s age without mentioning another civilization (that avoids the potential cultural implication).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a few alternative taglines you can use in different tones (celebratory, formal, global audience).\n- Give a one-paragraph blurb that\u2019s accurate and sensitive for marketing copy.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.98, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that Oxford predates the Aztec Empire and cites supporting dates (Oxford teaching ~1096; Aztec Empire c.1428), treating the claim as factually correct while only warning about cultural/reputational framing.

The Mexica/Aztec capital Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325. So if you mean \"Oxford (as an institution of higher learning/town) is older than the Aztec Empire/Tenochtitlan,\" that statement is accurate (Oxford predates the founding of Tenochtitlan by roughly two centuries).\n\nImportant caveats to avoid misleading viewers:\n- \u201cAztecs\u201d can mean different things. The Mexica/Aztec Empire and the city of Tenochtitlan date to the 14th century; but Mesoamerica had earlier advanced civilizations (Olmec, Teotihuacan, Maya) going back well before Oxford.
