Warranty of Factual Accuracy. Vendor represents and warrants that, as of the Effective Date, the Educational Materials delivered under this Agreement are factually accurate in all material respects. Without limiting the foregoing, Vendor specifically warrants that the genetics module entitled \u201c[Module Title]\u201d (the \u201cGenetics Module\u201d) correctly states that \u201cmost human somatic (non\u2011gamete) cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).\u201d An \u201cInaccuracy\u201d for purposes of this clause means a factual statement in the Genetics Module that is demonstrably false when measured against the generally accepted scientific consensus and peer\u2011reviewed sources as of the Effective Date.\n\n2. Notification and Verification. If Client believes that an Inaccuracy exists, Client shall provide Vendor written notice describing the alleged Inaccuracy with reasonable particularity, together with supporting documentation (the \u201cNotice\u201d). Vendor shall acknowledge receipt of the Notice within five (5) business days. Within ten (10) business days after acknowledgement, the parties shall confer in good faith and Vendor shall either (a) provide evidence that the challenged statement is accurate, or (b) confirm that the challenged statement constitutes an Inaccuracy.\n\n3. Correction. If Vendor confirms an Inaccuracy (or if an independent reviewer determines an Inaccuracy pursuant to Section 4), Vendor shall, at its sole cost and expense, correct the Inaccuracy and deliver corrected versions of the Genetics Module in all formats delivered under this Agreement, and, where reasonably practicable, notify recipients of the corrected content, within fifteen (15) business days after Vendor\u2019s confirmation (the \u201cCorrection Period\u201d). If the required correction cannot reasonably be completed within the Correction Period, Vendor shall (i) notify Client of the anticipated completion date and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the correction as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after confirmation, absent written agreement of the parties.\n\n4. Dispute; Independent Review. If Vendor disputes Client\u2019s Notice and the parties cannot resolve the dispute within ten (10) business days after Vendor\u2019s acknowledgement, either party may request that the matter be submitted to an independent, mutually agreeable scientific reviewer with relevant expertise (the \u201cReviewer\u201d). If the parties cannot agree on a Reviewer within five (5) business days, either party may request that a Reviewer be appointed by [name of agreed appointing body, e.g., \u201cthe American Society of Human Genetics\u201d] or, if unavailable, by a nationally recognized equivalent. The Reviewer\u2019s written determination as to whether the statement constitutes an Inaccuracy shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this clause, and the Reviewer shall be instructed to render a determination within ten (10) business days of appointment.\n\n5. Remedies. If Vendor confirms an Inaccuracy or the Reviewer determines that an Inaccuracy exists, Vendor\u2019s sole obligations and Client\u2019s exclusive remedies with respect to such Inaccuracy shall be, at Client\u2019s election: \n   (a) Correction Remedy: Vendor shall correct the Inaccuracy in accordance with Section 3 at Vendor\u2019s expense; or \n   (b) Refund/Credit Remedy: If Vendor fails to complete the correction within the Correction Period (or within any extended cure period agreed in writing), Vendor shall, at Client\u2019s election, either (i) refund to Client an amount equal to the fees paid by Client for the Genetics Module that contains the Inaccuracy, or (ii) provide a credit in an amount equal to such fees to be applied against future purchases of Vendor\u2019s educational materials, which credit shall be valid for twelve (12) months from issuance. If the Inaccuracy is pervasive and materially undermines the educational value of the Genetics Module as reasonably determined by Client, Client may terminate this Agreement for cause with respect to the affected module and receive a full refund of the fees paid for that module.\n\n6. Limitations and Exclusions. The warranty in Section 1 does not apply to inaccuracies resulting from (a) Client\u2019s modifications, adaptations or translations of the Genetics Module after delivery, (b) misuse of the Genetics Module, or (c) changes in scientific consensus or newly available scientific evidence that post\u2011date the Effective Date. Except as expressly provided in this clause, Vendor disclaims all other warranties, whether express or implied.\n\n7. Exclusive Remedy and Limitation of Liability. The correction and refund/credit remedies set forth in this clause shall be Client\u2019s sole and exclusive remedies, and Vendor\u2019s entire liability, for any Inaccuracy in the Genetics Module. In no event shall Vendor be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive or special damages arising out of any Inaccuracy.\n\n8. Survival.

So reproductive cells do not have 46.\n- Enucleated cells: mature red blood cells in mammals have no nucleus (so no nuclear chromosomes).\n- Common constitutional aneuploidies (whole\u2011body or mosaic):\n  - Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) \u2014 extra chromosome 21 (most common autosomal trisomy among live births).\n  - Sex\u2011chromosome aneuploidies (e.g., 47,XXY Klinefelter; 45,X Turner; 47,XYY).\n  - These make an individual\u2019s somatic cells have a non\u201146 count (or mosaics with some 46 and some non\u201146 cells).\n- Mosaicism and chimerism: some people have mixtures of cell lines with different karyotypes (e.g., some cells 46, others 45 or 47). Mosaicism can be relatively common in embryos and in some tissues.\n- Somatic aneuploidy and copy\u2011number variation:\n  - Many cancers and precancerous tissues show aneuploidy and chromosomal instability \u2014 tumor cells often do not have 46 chromosomes.\n  - Somatic cells can carry subchromosomal copy\u2011number variants or extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in tumors.\n- Tissue\u2011specific polyploidy or multinucleation:\n  - Some normal human cells are polyploid or multinucleated (e.g., many hepatocytes are tetraploid or octoploid; skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated; osteoclasts are multinucleated). Counting \u201cchromosomes per cell\u201d is therefore ambiguous in those cell types.\n- Developmental stages:\n  - Early embryonic cells can be mosaic or aneuploid; meiosis produces haploid gametes; zygote starts diploid but early divisions can create variation.\n- Laboratory or artificially modified cells:\n  - Cell lines (e.g., HeLa) and many cultured cells have abnormal karyotypes; hybrids or manipulated cells also differ.\n- Semantic/technical points that cause confusion:\n  - \u201c46 chromosomes\u201d refers to nuclear chromosomes; mitochondria have their own small circular genomes but these aren\u2019t counted as human \u201cchromosomes\u201d in the karyotype sense.\n  - Saying \u201cevery human cell has 46 chromosomes\u201d is false because of enucleated cells, gametes, and the exceptions above.\n  - \u201cMost cells\u201d depends on interpretation: most somatic cell types in a typical, healthy adult are diploid 46, but many tissues and disease states commonly deviate.\n\nPrevalence notes (quick reference)\n- Down syndrome ~1 in 600\u20131000 live births (CDC provides up\u2011to\u2011date figures by region).\n- Klinefelter syndrome ~1 in 500\u20131,000 male births.\n- Turner syndrome (~45,X) ~1 in 2,500 live female births.\n- Aneuploidy and chromosomal abnormalities are far more frequent in miscarriages/early embryos than in live births.\n- Cancer aneuploidy is common in tumors (many solid tumors show chromosomal abnormalities).\n\nSuggested short, accurate phrasing for broadcast\n- \u201cThe usual human somatic cell is diploid with 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), but exceptions are common: reproductive cells have 23, red blood cells lack nuclei, some people have chromosomal disorders or mosaicism, some tissues show polyploidy, and cancer cells often have abnormal chromosome numbers.\u201d\n\nGood authoritative sources to cite or check\n- NCBI Bookshelf / standard genetics textbooks (e.g., \u201cHuman Molecular Genetics\u201d)\n- National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) overview pages\n- Genetics Home Reference / MedlinePlus / CDC pages for aneuploidy prevalence\n- OMIM or review articles for specific syndromes and mosaicism\n\nIf you want, I can pull a single authoritative citation (URL and a short quoted sentence) you can read on air.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.9, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms that most human somatic (non\u2011reproductive) cells are diploid with 46 chromosomes and provides that as the short answer, while also enumerating many exceptions (gametes, enucleated RBCs, aneuploidies, mosaicism, cancer, polyploid tissues).

It denotes the number of distinct chromosomes in a single nucleus. Karyotype notation is usually written 46,XX or 46,XY.\n\n- Cell-cycle note: after DNA replication (S phase) each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, so a cell has 46 chromosomes but 92 chromatids until mitosis separates them.\n\n- Gametes: sperm and eggs are haploid (n = 23). Fertilization restores 2n = 46.\n\n- Anucleate cells: mature red blood cells and platelets have no nucleus, so they contain no chromosomal DNA in their cytoplasm.\n\n- Normal tissue exceptions:\n  - Some normal somatic cells are polyploid or multinucleated (e.g., many hepatocytes, cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle fibers). Those cells can have more than 46 chromosomes per cell/nucleus or multiple nuclei.\n  - Low-level somatic mosaicism for aneuploidy or copy-number variation is common and rises with age.\n\n- Genetic variants and syndromes:\n  - Sex chromosome and autosomal aneuploidies exist (e.g., 47,XXY Klinefelter; 45,X Turner; trisomy 21), so not everyone has exactly 46 chromosomes.\n  - Balanced translocations (e.g., Robertsonian translocation) can leave someone phenotypically normal with 45 chromosomes while retaining essentially the normal complement of genetic material.\n\n- Disease and cancer: many cancers show widespread aneuploidy and structural chromosome rearrangements; cancer cells often do not have 46 chromosomes.\n\n- Practical/diagnostic: routine karyotyping of blood lymphocytes in a healthy person typically shows 46 chromosomes. But that is a snapshot of that tissue and time.\n\n- Other DNA: mitochondrial DNA exists in many copies per cell but is not counted in chromosome number.\n\nSuggested concise exam phrasing\n- \u201cMost somatic, nucleated human cells are diploid (46 chromosomes: 46,XX or 46,XY).

You have 23 pairs of socks.\u201d  \n- Visuals: karyotype image showing 23 paired chromosomes; diagram contrasting diploid cell (2n=46) vs haploid gamete (n=23); meiosis vs mitosis flowchart (how number is halved/restored or preserved).  \n- Demonstrate a metaphase spread or a prepared karyotype to show how scientists count chromosomes.\n\n4) Key exceptions and nuances to teach explicitly\n- \u201cMost\u201d is important \u2014 exceptions exist:\n  - Gametes (sperm and egg) have 23, not 46.  \n  - Mature red blood cells in humans lack nuclei and so have no nuclear chromosomes.  \n  - Some normal cells can be polyploid (e.g., some liver cells can be binucleated or have extra chromosome sets).  \n  - Aneuploidy and chromosomal disorders (e.g., trisomy 21) produce abnormal chromosome counts in some individuals.  \n  - Mosaicism \u2014 some people have two different cell lines with different chromosome complements.  \n  - Cancer cells often show abnormal chromosome numbers (chromosomal instability).  \n- Make sure tutors avoid absolute phrasing like \u201cevery human cell has 46 chromosomes.\u201d Teach them to say \u201cmost somatic cells.\u201d\n\n5) Common student misconceptions and suggested responses\n- Misconception: \u201cChromosome number equals number of genes.\u201d \u2014 Response: \u201cNo; chromosomes are structures that carry many genes. Gene number and chromosome number are different concepts.\u201d  \n- Misconception: \u201cFemales always have identical sex chromosomes.\u201d \u2014 Response: \u201cFemales usually have two X chromosomes (XX) but one X is largely inactivated in each cell (X-inactivation).\u201d  \n- Misconception: \u201cIf someone has 47 chromosomes they are a different species.\u201d \u2014 Response: \u201cExtra or missing chromosomes (aneuploidy) are usually errors that can cause developmental issues; they don\u2019t make a separate species.\u201d\n\n6) Teaching tips and emphasis points\n- Always pair the fact (46 in most somatic cells) with the why: 23 from each parent, diploid vs haploid. That helps students remember.  \n- Use a karyotype image every time you teach this to anchor the number visually.  \n- Show meiosis briefly to explain why gametes have 23. For basic lessons, a simple two-step \u201cmeiosis halves, fertilization restores\u201d is fine.  \n- Stress the word \u201cmost\u201d early to avoid overgeneralization. Give two common exceptions (gametes and red blood cells) so students recall nuance.  \n- Encourage students to answer \u201cHow many chromosomes?\u201d by specifying the cell type (somatic vs gamete).\n\n7) Short classroom activities\n- Karyotype sorting: give images of chromosomes, have students pair them into 23 pairs and count.  \n- Card analogy: give two sets of 23 cards (mother/father), shuffle and make pairs.  \n- Meiosis role-play: have students \u201cdivide chromosomes\u201d to show how a gamete gets 23.\n\n8) Quick assessment questions (examples)\n- Multiple choice: \u201cHow many chromosomes are in a normal human somatic cell? A) 23 B) 46 C) 92 D) depends on the person.\u201d (Correct: B; but discuss \u201cdepends\u201d re: exceptions.)  \n- Short answer: \u201cExplain why a fertilized egg has 46 chromosomes.\u201d  \n- True/False: \u201cMature human red blood cells contain 46 chromosomes.\u201d (False.)\n\n9) Language to avoid\n- Avoid absolute statements like \u201cevery cell\u201d or \u201calways.\u201d Avoid conflating chromosomes with genes or DNA sequences. Avoid implying 46 is true for gametes.\n\n10) References and visuals to provide tutors\n- A simple karyotype image labeled 1\u201322 and sex chromosomes.  \n- A meiosis/mitosis comparison diagram.  \n- Short textbook sections or reliable online resources (e.g., university biology pages, Genetics Home Reference / NIH) to support deeper questions.\n\n11) FAQ for tutors\n- Q: \u201cWhy 46 specifically?\u201d A: \u201cBecause humans inherit 23 chromosomes from each parent; the number is a species characteristic maintained by sexual reproduction.\u201d  \n- Q: \u201cCan chromosome number change?\u201d A: \u201cYes \u2014 in gametes (half), in some abnormal conditions (aneuploidy), some tissues can be polyploid, and cancer cells often change number.\u201d\n\nGive tutors this sheet as a one-page reference to carry into lessons.

The model accepts '46' as a valid answer and treats the chromosome number as a settled scientific claim. The response refines the phrasing for clarity and acknowledges edge cases (gametes, aneuploidies, red blood cells) without questioning the core claim.
