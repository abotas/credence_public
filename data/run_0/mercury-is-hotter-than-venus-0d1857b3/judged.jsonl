Its thick CO2 atmosphere and huge greenhouse effect make its average surface temperature about 735 K (\u2248462 \u00b0C, 864 \u00b0F), hotter than any place on Mercury.\n\nDetails and numbers\n- Venus: mean surface temperature \u2248 735 K (462 \u00b0C / 864 \u00b0F). Temperatures are very uniform over the planet because the dense atmosphere redistributes heat; day/night and equator/pole differences are only a few tens of degrees at most. Measurements come from Soviet Venera landers and later missions.\n- Mercury: extreme swings because it has almost no atmosphere. Daytime near the subsolar point can reach about 700 K (\u2248427 \u00b0C / 800 \u00b0F). Nighttime temperatures can fall to roughly 100 K (\u2248\u2212173 \u00b0C / \u2212280 \u00b0F).

That traps far more heat than Mercury gains from being closer to the Sun.\n- Mercury has low albedo and is closer to the Sun, so its dayside gets very hot, but without an atmosphere it cannot retain that heat and so its nights are extremely cold.\n\nWhy sources get mixed up\n- Some statements about Mercury being \u201chottest\u201d are informal shorthand referring to its proximity to the Sun or to daytime peak temperatures.

Venus stays hot everywhere.\n\nSimple analogy for a student\n- Think of Mercury like a bare rock in sunlight: very hot where the Sun hits, very cold in shade.

But that doesn\u2019t mean your Mercury-as-hardest design is necessarily wrong \u2014 it depends on which kinds of \"difficulty\" you mean and how you present it.\n\nKey facts you can cite in the game or to the testers\n- Solar flux: Mercury (0.387 AU) receives ~6.7\u00d7 Earth\u2019s sunlight, Venus (0.723 AU) ~1.9\u00d7. Being closer gives much higher incoming radiation at Mercury\u2019s sub-solar point.\n- Temperatures: Mercury\u2019s dayside can reach roughly +400 to +430 \u00b0C but nights fall to about \u2212180 \u00b0C (huge swings). Venus\u2019s surface is ~460\u2013475 \u00b0C almost everywhere (and nearly constant).\n- Atmosphere/pressure: Mercury has effectively no atmosphere; Venus has a ~92 bar CO2 atmosphere with sulfuric-acid clouds. That atmosphere produces a runaway greenhouse and very high, uniform surface temperatures and is corrosive and crushing.\n- Rotation/heat redistribution: Venus\u2019s dense atmosphere efficiently redistributes heat, so its surface is uniformly hot despite being farther from the Sun. Mercury\u2019s thin/no atmosphere yields extreme local heating and thermal shock.\n\nImplications for game design (non\u2011expensive ways to reconcile)\n- If \u201chottest\u201d is what testers meant, revise flavor text: \u201cVenus\u2019s surface is hotter overall thanks to a runaway greenhouse; Mercury gets much stronger solar flux and extreme day/night swings.\u201d This is a simple text/content fix.\n- If you want Mercury to remain the single hardest planet, justify it with other realistic hazards rather than pure steady temperature: extreme thermal cycling and localized solar flux, intense radiation and charged particles, no atmosphere for braking, micrometeoroid bombardment, and engineering problems from massive thermal gradients and lack of convective cooling. Those are scientifically plausible and make Mercury uniquely brutal for equipment and survival.\n- Or split difficulty types: Venus = deadly due to constant high temp + crushing pressure + corrosive atmosphere (long missions require hulls, cooling, corrosion protection); Mercury = deadly due to extreme thermal spikes, rapid thermal fatigue, vacuum\u2011cooling limits, radiation, and operational constraints (very short windows for sun-facing activities). You can make different tech/gear required for each planet.\n\nConcrete, low-cost adjustments you can make\n- Tweak planetary descriptions and UI tooltips to include the greenhouse/pressure fact (no art or code change).\n- Add a simple mechanic to differentiate: Mercury causes equipment to suffer thermal shock and system failures during the day/night transitions; Venus causes steadily increasing heat-stress and requires pressure-rated components. This is mostly balancing/tweaking parameters.\n- If you want strict realism and immersion, change the \u201chottest planet\u201d text to Venus and keep Mercury as the \u201cmost hostile\u201d for other reasons.\n\nRecommendation\n- If immersion with scientific correctness matters, change the wording so Venus is acknowledged as hotter while keeping Mercury \u201cmost difficult\u201d for other realistic hazards. That requires minimal work.\n- If testers want strict realism (Venus hardest overall), you can re-balance difficulty slowly by making Venus\u2019s constant heat/pressure a tougher mechanical challenge than Mercury\u2019s extremes.\n\nIf you want, I can draft revised in-game descriptions for Mercury and Venus (short tooltips) and suggest specific gameplay mechanics and parameter ranges to reflect these scientific differences.
