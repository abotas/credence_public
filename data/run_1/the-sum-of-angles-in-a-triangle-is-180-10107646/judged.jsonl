In exact Euclidean geometry it's true, but in floating-point code it is fragile and often the wrong thing to test. Prefer tests based on side lengths and area; if you check angles then do it robustly and with a configurable tolerance.\n\nWhy it\u2019s fragile\n- Floating-point rounding: separately computed angles (via acos or atan2) rarely add to exactly \u03c0; small rounding errors accumulate.\n- Degenerate / nearly-degenerate triangles: one angle \u2248 \u03c0 and two \u2248 0 can amplify error and produce misleading sums.\n- Computation method matters: acos suffers from poor accuracy for angles near 0 or \u03c0 unless you clamp and use robust formulas.\n- Non\u2011Euclidean contexts: on a sphere/hyperbolic plane the interior angle sum \u2260 \u03c0, so the check would be wrong by design.\n\nWhat you should validate instead (recommended)\n1. Distinct vertices: ensure points are not coincident (||B\u2212A|| > eps, etc.).\n2. Non\u2011collinearity (non\u2011degenerate): check signed area (cross product) is not zero:\n   area2 = cross(B\u2212A, C\u2212A)  (twice the signed area). Require |area2| > area_eps.\n3. Triangle inequality on side lengths:\n   let a = |BC|, b = |CA|, c = |AB|\n   require a + b > c + tol && b + c > a + tol && c + a > b + tol\n   (this is numerically stable and directly enforces a geometric triangle).\n4. Optionally: compare area from coordinates to Heron\u2019s formula (consistency check).\n\nHow to pick tolerances\n- Use eps derived from machine precision and the scale of input coordinates.\n  - machine_epsilon (double) \u2248 2.22e-16.\n  - absolute tolerance: abs_eps = scale * machine_epsilon * safety_factor, where scale = max(|coords|) (or max side length).\n  - relative tolerance: rel_eps = 1e-12 \u2026 1e-9 is a practical choice for double arithmetic on unit-scale geometry; allow loosening for noisy inputs.\n- Example defaults (double):\n  - area_eps = scale^2 * 1e-12 (or scale * machine_epsilon * 100)\n  - side_tol = scale * 1e-12\n  - angle_tol (if you insist on angle-sum test): use something like 1e-12 to 1e-9 radians (configurable)\n- Make tolerances configurable in your library.\n\nIf you do check angle sum: how to compute angles robustly\n- Compute each interior angle using atan2 of cross and dot of edge vectors:\n  u = (B\u2212A) normalized, v = (C\u2212A) normalized\n  angleA = atan2(|cross(u,v)|, dot(u,v))  // gives value in [0, \u03c0], numerically stable\n- Clamp dot arguments when using acos: cos\u03b8 = clamp(dot/(|u||v|), \u22121, 1) before acos.\n- Sum angles: S = angleA + angleB + angleC. Expect S \u2248 \u03c0; test |S\u2212\u03c0| \u2264 angle_tol.\n- Be aware: for nearly-degenerate triangles floating-point cancellation can make S inaccurate; prefer the side/area checks.\n\nPseudocode (recommended validator)\n- Inputs: A, B, C; scale = max(|A|,|B|,|C|, 1.0); rel = 1e-12\n- a = |B\u2212C|; b = |C\u2212A|; c = |A\u2212B|\n- side_tol = scale * rel\n- if a <= side_tol || b <= side_tol || c <= side_tol: reject (coincident points)\n- if a + b <= c + side_tol || b + c <= a + side_tol || c + a <= b + side_tol: reject (triangle inequality fails)\n- area2 = cross(B\u2212A, C\u2212A)  // scalar for 2D or norm of cross for 3D\n- area_eps = scale * scale * rel\n- if |area2| <= area_eps: reject (degenerate/collinear)\n- pass\n\nOther considerations\n- Expose validation levels: none, basic (distinct + triangle inequality), strict (add area/consistency checks), debug (add angle-sum).\n- For inputs from measurement or user data be generous with tolerances; for high-precision computation be stricter.\n- Document clearly which geometry is assumed (Euclidean) and how tolerances are computed.\n\nBottom line\n- The mathematical rule \"angles sum to 180\u00b0\" is valid in Euclidean geometry, but it\u2019s a brittle test in floating-point code.

In the Euclidean plane the interior angles of any triangle add exactly to 180\u00b0. The only time the sum differs systematically is on a curved surface (spherical triangles sum to >180\u00b0, hyperbolic to <180\u00b0).\n\nWhy your measurements were off\n- Instrument and reading error: typical classroom protractors have 1\u00b0 marks and human alignment/reading errors of about \u00b10.5\u20132\u00b0 are common.  \n- Drawing error: vertices made with thick pencil lines or imperfect straight lines move the true vertex.  \n- Scale/size: small triangles make angle reading more sensitive to small positioning errors.  \n- Parallax: viewing the protractor at an angle shifts readings.  \n- Paper not flat or warped will introduce tiny curvature.  \n- Rounding/adding: you may have rounded each angle before summing.\n\nA clean test plan\nMaterials: a good rigid ruler/straightedge, a fine sharp pencil, a protractor (or vernier/digital angle finder if available), scissors or a printer, and optionally GeoGebra (free) or a camera with tripod for a top-down photo.\n\nProcedure A \u2014 simple, low-tech, very convincing (cut-and-reassemble)\n1. Draw a triangle on flat paper, fairly large (each side \u226510 cm).  \n2. Carefully cut out the three corner pieces so that each piece contains exactly one vertex (trim along the angle bisectors? \u2014 just cut close to the vertex along the sides).  \n3. Bring the three cut corners together so their vertices meet at a point. Arrange them so their straight edges lie flush; you should be able to form a straight line (single 180\u00b0) where the three outer edges line up.  \n4. Repeat with several different triangles.  \nResult: this demonstrates directly, with almost no instrument error, that the 3 interior angles make a straight line (180\u00b0).\n\nProcedure B \u2014 folded-paper method (no scissors)\n1. Fold a triangle\u2019s three corners so the tips meet at one point; the three fold creases form a straight line if the sum is 180\u00b0.  \n2. This is easier if you make the triangle large.\n\nProcedure C \u2014 careful protractor measurements (quantitative)\n1. Draw several large triangles (different shapes and sizes).  \n2. For each vertex, extend the sides a little to make the protractor placement easier. Mark the exact intersection point of the two side lines with a very small dot.  \n3. Place the protractor with its center exactly on the dot, align one baseline carefully, read the other angle. Take three independent readings per angle (repositioning the protractor each time) and average.  \n4. Sum averaged angles. Estimate your reading uncertainty (\u00b10.5\u00b0 is optimistic; \u00b11\u00b0\u20132\u00b0 typical).  \nExpected outcome: sums will be within your estimated uncertainty of 180\u00b0.\n\nProcedure D \u2014 measurement by side lengths (law of cosines)\n1. Draw a large triangle and measure its three side lengths accurately (use calipers or a metric ruler; aim for \u00b10.5 mm or better).  \n2. Compute each angle from the side lengths using the law of cosines. This avoids protractor reading error; accuracy depends on length accuracy.  \n3. Sum the computed angles.  \nGood results if you measure sides carefully.\n\nProcedure E \u2014 digital verification\n1. Use GeoGebra or another geometry app: construct a triangle and have the program report the angles; you\u2019ll get exact sums equal to 180\u00b0 (within numerical rounding).  \n2. Or photograph the triangle from directly above with a tripod, import the image into software that can detect lines and calculate angles.\n\nHow to interpret results\n- If the sums are within your estimated measurement uncertainty (say \u00b12\u00b0), they are consistent with 180\u00b0.  \n- If you consistently measure sums significantly above or below 180\u00b0 even after careful procedures, check whether the paper/board is curved\u2014or whether you unknowingly drew on a curved surface (balloon, globe). On a sphere, the excess above 180\u00b0 is proportional to the triangle\u2019s area (spherical excess).\n\nWhat to expect numerically\n- Classroom protractor: typical total-angle error a few degrees (so 178\u2013182 is completely normal).  \n- Cut-and-reassemble or folding: should show visually that the angles make a straight line (convincing qualitative proof).  \n- GeoGebra / analytical computation: sums to 180\u00b0 within machine rounding (0.0...1e-10).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give step-by-step photos/sketches for the cut-and-reassemble or folding method, or  \n- Walk you through using GeoGebra or a spreadsheet to compute angles from measured side lengths.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that in the Euclidean plane the interior angles of any triangle add exactly to 180\u00b0, treats deviations as measurement error or as occurring only on curved surfaces, and proposes multiple tests that assume the 180\u00b0 rule; this expresses very high confidence in the proposition.", "judge2_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "judge2_refusal": false, "judge2_informative": true, "judge2_credence": 0.99, "judge2_explanation": "The MODEL unequivocally endorses the proposition as a mathematical fact about Euclidean geometry.

That follows from Euclid\u2019s parallel postulate.\n- On a sphere (spherical geometry) the sum is greater than 180\u00b0. Example: on a globe take the North Pole and two points on the equator 90\u00b0 apart. The triangle formed by the two meridians and the equator has three right angles: 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 270\u00b0.\n- In hyperbolic geometry the sum is less than 180\u00b0. (This is harder to show physically, but many models and pictures illustrate it.)\n- More formally, the deviation from 180\u00b0 is tied to the surface\u2019s curvature: on a sphere the excess is proportional to the triangle\u2019s area; in hyperbolic space there\u2019s a deficit proportional to area.\n\nHow to handle it with the teacher\n- Most likely the teacher meant \u201cevery triangle in the plane\u201d (the standard classroom assumption).

Exclusions and Non\u2011Applicability\nThe Statement shall not be construed to apply to:\n- triangles defined on non\u2011Euclidean geometries (including spherical, elliptic or hyperbolic geometries), to triangles formed by geodesics on curved surfaces, or to any triangle embedded in a non\u2011flat manifold;\n- degenerate triangles (three collinear points) or other pathological constructions outside the Definitions above;\n- contexts where angles are defined by a nonstandard or application\u2011specific convention unless the Course Materials explicitly identify and define that convention.\n\n4. Measurement and Numerical Tolerance\nIf the Statement is demonstrated or measured empirically (e.g., using physical instruments, drawings or numerical computations), Vendor may show results that differ from 180 degrees only by customary measurement or numerical error. Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, a discrepancy of up to \u00b10.5 degrees (or the equivalent in radians) shall be treated as consistent with the Statement when empirical methods are used.

Use language like \u201cIn Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry, the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0.\u201d Avoid an unqualified \u201calways\u201d or \u201ceverywhere.\u201d\n- Teach the assumption.

That gives both reliable problem\u2011solving tools and a deeper grasp of what \u201cmathematical truth\u201d means.\n\nWhy not one extreme or the other (briefly)\n- Presenting 180\u00b0 as an unquestioned fundamental rule is simple and useful for calculation, but it can leave students with an implicit view that mathematics is a list of facts instead of a system built on assumptions. It can inhibit understanding of proof and of why different results are possible under different assumptions.\n- Introducing non\u2011Euclidean geometry very early and treating 180\u00b0 only as \u201csometimes true\u201d can be enlightening for advanced students, but it can confuse learners who haven\u2019t yet mastered basic spatial intuition, measurement, and the idea of logical deduction from axioms. It risks cognitive overload and superficial misconceptions if not well scaffolded.\n\nWhat builds better mathematical understanding\n- Axiomatic thinking: The best approach emphasizes axioms and why theorems follow from them. Teach Euclidean geometry as a coherent system (points/lines/parallel postulate) and show how triangle-angle-sum is a derived theorem, not a primitive fact.\n- Concrete first, abstract next: Begin with measurements, constructions, and proofs in flat (Euclidean) plane geometry so students build intuition and technical skill. Then introduce curved surfaces (spheres) and hyperbolic models to show how changing the parallel postulate changes theorems.\n- Comparative examples: Use activities that make the contrast vivid \u2014 e.g., measure triangles on paper (sum \u2248180\u00b0) vs triangles on a sphere made from great circles (sum >180\u00b0), or use Poincar\u00e9 disk animations to see many \"straight\" geodesics and angle behavior in hyperbolic space.\n- Historical/contextual framing: Present the parallel postulate\u2019s historical struggle and how alternatives led to rich mathematics (and to relativity). That helps students see mathematics as evolving, connected, and creative.\n\nPractical guidance for choosing between the two programs\nAsk these about each program:\n- How do they introduce the triangle angle-sum? As an axiom, a theorem, or an experimental observation?\n- Do they teach axioms, models, and proofs explicitly?\n- At what grade/level do they introduce non\u2011Euclidean ideas and with what scaffolding (manipulatives, models, computer visualizations)?\n- What professional background do the teachers have in geometry and in teaching proof-based thinking?\n- How are students assessed (rote procedures, proofs, projects, conceptual tasks)?\n- Are there hands-on activities (paper models, spherical triangles, geodesic experiments, software)?\n\nSuggested choice by student profile\n- Elementary / early middle school (typical learner): Prefer a program that emphasizes Euclidean geometry, measurement, and simple proofs first but includes qualitative exposure to curved surfaces or a demonstration that \u201cgeometry can be different.\u201d\n- Middle / high school student preparing for advanced math or STEM: Prefer the program that teaches Euclidean geometry axiomatically and then introduces non\u2011Euclidean geometry as a conditional alternative with concrete models and proofs. That builds rigor and mathematical maturity.\n- Gifted/advanced younger student: A program that brings in non\u2011Euclidean ideas early can be great if teachers are experienced and the student is ready for abstraction.\n\nConcrete activities that mark a strong program\n- Prove triangle-angle-sum from parallel postulate and show consequences.\n- Measure sums of angles of many physical triangles (paper, taped string) to see empirical support and limitations.\n- Construct spherical triangles (e.g., tape on a ball) and measure angle sums >180\u00b0.\n- Use a Poincar\u00e9 disk applet or crochet hyperbolic models to explore hyperbolic triangles (angle sum <180\u00b0).\n- Projects on the history of the parallel postulate and models of curved spaces.\n\nRecommendation\nIf you must pick one program: choose the one that treats 180\u00b0 as a derived theorem within a clear axiomatic framework and that introduces non\u2011Euclidean geometry later with good models and teacher support.

That is a theorem, not an empirical claim: it follows from the standard axioms of Euclidean geometry and can be proved in several short, classroom-friendly ways.\n- Viral posts claiming \u201ctriangles don\u2019t add to 180\u00b0, so school geometry is false\u201d are almost certainly wrong as a general claim. Nearly all sensible uses of \u201ctriangle\u201d in school geometry assume a flat plane, and within that framework the theorem holds.\n\nCaveats (brief, necessary)\n- The 180\u00b0 result depends on the geometry being flat (Euclidean). On curved surfaces (e.g., the sphere) or in non\u2011Euclidean geometries, triangle angle sums differ: on a sphere the sum is greater than 180\u00b0; in hyperbolic geometry it is less than 180\u00b0. So the viral posts are sometimes showing a true effect in a non\u2011Euclidean setting, but that does not invalidate Euclidean school geometry.\n- Practical measurements can show apparent disagreement because of measurement error, pixelation in digital images, imperfect straight lines, or tricks in diagrams (curved \u201clines,\u201d perspective distortion, or small gaps introduced by cutting and reassembling).

This is elementary, rigorous under Euclid/Hilbert axioms, and easy to reproduce in photos or a short video.\n\n2) Simple measurement (reproducible)\n- Draw any triangle on a flat sheet of paper, measure the three interior angles with a quality protractor or digital angle finder (or use a geometry app like GeoGebra), and add them; they will sum to 180\u00b0 within measurement error. This addresses the \u201cbut I measured otherwise\u201d claim.\n\n3) Demonstration of the counterexample they usually mean (spherical case)\n- Show a triangle on a globe made of great circles: e.g., North Pole and two points on equator 90\u00b0 apart \u2014 three right angles \u2192 270\u00b0.

But if your problem lives on a curved manifold (Earth\u2011scale navigation, relativity, hyperbolic networks, etc.) you must treat non\u2011Euclidean geometry fully.\n\nHow to decide and how much time to spend\n\n1) Identify the geometric regime (hours\u2013days)\n- Where do your triangles live? (plane patch, Earth surface, astronomical scale, curved surface of an object, abstract Riemannian/hyperbolic space, discrete graph with curvature)\n- What are the typical triangle sizes (diameter or area)?\n- What accuracy/error tolerance does your application require?\n\nDo this immediately (a few hours to a day). If the answer is \u201cflat patch, tiny triangles, coarse tolerance,\u201d you\u2019re done: the Euclidean assumption is fine with a short justification.\n\n2) Do a back\u2011of\u2011the\u2011envelope curvature check (a few hours)\n- For a surface with Gaussian curvature K(x), Gauss\u2013Bonnet gives, for a geodesic triangle T:\n  sum_of_angles(T) \u2212 \u03c0 = \u222b\u222b_T K dA.\n  For constant curvature K (sphere of radius R, K = 1/R^2),\n  sum_of_angles = \u03c0 + K \u00b7 area(T).\n- For small triangles on a surface with |K| \u2264 Kmax and triangle diameter \u2264 D, the angle\u2011sum deviation is O(Kmax \u00b7 area) \u2264 C \u00b7 Kmax \u00b7 D^2 (area scales like D^2).\n\nExample (Earth): R \u2248 6371 km so K = 1/R^2 \u2248 2.46\u00d710^\u22128 km^\u22122.\n- area = 1 km^2 \u2192 excess \u2248 2.46\u00d710^\u22128 rad (negligible).\n- area = 1,000,000 km^2 \u2192 excess \u2248 0.025 rad \u2248 1.4\u00b0 (not negligible).\nSo if your triangles are \u2264 few kilometers, Earth curvature is irrelevant; if they are continental scale, it matters.\n\nTime: this step takes hours to a couple of days to compute and write a short lemma showing the effect is \u2264 your tolerance.\n\n3) If the curvature effect is not negligible: choose the right level of treatment\n- Short rigorous addendum (1\u20132 weeks): Literature search + include a lemma/corollary bounding the error or giving the corrected formulas (spherical/hyperbolic trig, Gauss\u2013Bonnet, or a comparison theorem). This is usually enough to satisfy reviewers/advisors.\n- Moderate extension (several weeks\u20131\u20132 months): Rework key proofs/algorithms in the constant\u2011curvature (spherical/hyperbolic) setting or for manifolds with bounded curvature; derive explicit error terms and update experiments/simulations.\n- Full generalization (multiple months): Develop a full theory on Riemannian manifolds, prove general theorems (use Toponogov comparison, Alexandrov spaces, Gromov hyperbolicity depending on context), implement non\u2011Euclidean algorithms, and run extensive tests.\n\nWhich route you need depends on your advisor\u2019s demand and the project goals. In many applied projects a short rigorous justification (hours\u2013two weeks) is sufficient.\n\nSuggested minimal content to satisfy rigor\n- Explicitly state the Euclidean assumption and its domain of validity.\n- Provide a quantitative bound on angle\u2011sum deviation: e.g., for triangles with diameter \u2264 D on a surface with |K| \u2264 Kmax, show |sum_of_angles \u2212 \u03c0| \u2264 C \u00b7 Kmax \u00b7 D^2 (or use Gauss\u2013Bonnet to produce a precise bound).\n- If relevant, show how to replace Euclidean formulas by their spherical/hyperbolic analogues (give references).\n- If non\u2011Euclidean corrections are negligible for your parameters, give numerical examples (like the Earth example) and cite standard references (do Carmo, Gauss\u2013Bonnet, spherical trigonometry).\n\nPractical next steps for you (concrete)\n- Ask your advisor: what level of non\u2011Euclidean generality do they expect? (a brief bound, spherical case, full manifold case?)\n- Do the curvature check for your typical triangle sizes (I can help compute those numbers).\n- If needed, draft a 1\u20132 page appendix: state assumptions, compute the bound, and add references.

The difference arises from different assumptions about \u201cparallel lines\u201d/curvature.\n- Making the assumption explicit prevents later confusion and introduces students to the idea that mathematics depends on definitions and axioms.\n\nSuggested change to the standard wording\n- Current terse version: \u201cThe angles of a triangle sum to 180\u00b0.\u201d\n- Revised: \u201cIn Euclidean (flat\u2011plane) geometry, the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180\u00b0.

Use dynamic geometry software (GeoGebra) to drag vertices and observe invariance.\n2.

Emphasize the parallel\u2011line/Euclidean assumption used in the proof.\n3. Introduce the idea of axioms: briefly explain that results depend on assumptions (e.g., the parallel postulate).\n4. Counterexamples/extension activity: use a globe or a ball to draw \u201cgreat\u2011circle\u201d triangles (e.g., two meridians and the equator) to show sums >180\u00b0.

General assumptions\n- Work in Euclidean geometry (flat planes and straight lines) unless explicitly modeling a curved surface.  \n- Always state units and drawing precision at the start of a drawing set (e.g., metric \u2192 mm to 1 mm; imperial \u2192 inches to 1/16\" or 1/8\", depending on stage).\n\n2. Points, lines, planes\n- Point: location, no size.  \n- Line: infinite in both directions; Line segment: between two points.  \n- Plane: a flat 2\u2011D surface; most floor plans and elevations are planar views.\n\n3. Distances and coordinates\n- Distance (2D): d = sqrt[(x2 \u2212 x1)^2 + (y2 \u2212 y1)^2].  \n- Midpoint: ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2).  \n- Use consistent coordinate system and origin; keep units consistent between CAD imports and site survey.\n\n4. Angles and conversions\n- Degrees, minutes, seconds (\u00b0 ' \") and radians.  \n- Conversion: radians = degrees \u00d7 \u03c0/180.  \n- Standard drafting convention: measure angles from a baseline (e.g., positive X axis) and record rotation direction (CW/CCW).\n\n5. Triangles (very commonly used)\n- Angle-sum: interior angles of a triangle = 180\u00b0 (Euclidean plane).  \n- Right triangle: Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (c = hypotenuse).  \n- Area: (base \u00d7 height) / 2.  \n- Heron\u2019s formula (when sides a,b,c known): area = sqrt[s(s\u2212a)(s\u2212b)(s\u2212c)] where s = (a+b+c)/2.  \n- Centroid (triangle): average of vertex coordinates \u2014 useful for simple balance/centering tasks.\n\n6. Similarity and congruence\n- Similar triangles: same angles; side lengths proportional \u2014 used for scaling and indirect measurements.  \n- Congruent shapes: identical in size and shape (rigid transformations only).\n\n7. Polygons (common ones)\n- Rectangle area: width \u00d7 length.  \n- Trapezoid area: (a + b)/2 \u00d7 height.  \n- General polygon area (coordinate method): use shoelace formula in CAD or compute via triangulation.\n\n8. Circles, arcs, tangents\n- Radius (r), diameter (d = 2r), circumference = 2\u03c0r, area = \u03c0r^2.  \n- Arc length (radians): s = r \u00d7 \u03b8. If \u03b8 in degrees: s = \u03c0r\u03b8/180.  \n- Tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact \u2014 important for driveway arcs, fillets, and curb radii.\n\n9. Perpendiculars, parallelism, bisectors\n- Perpendicular bisector: locus of points equidistant from two points \u2014 useful for setting out centerlines and circle centers.  \n- Use geometric constraints in CAD (parallel/perpendicular/collinear) to reduce dimensioning errors.\n\n10. Slopes, pitch, and roof geometry\n- Slope = rise/run. Roof pitch often given as \"X in 12\". Conversion to angle: \u03b8 = arctan(rise/run).  \n- Drainage minimum slopes and roofing thresholds are code/assembly-specific \u2014 consult the spec.\n\n11. Areas and material takeoffs\n- Use exact geometric formulas for base quantities; for complex shapes, triangulate or use polygon area functions in CAD.  \n- Account for wall thickness (offset inner/outer faces) when computing floor area vs gross exterior footprint.\n\n12. Practical drafting tips\n- Set layer and snap standards to avoid accidental wrong-unit drawing.  \n- Dimension to the actual construction face (e.g., finish face or stud face) and call out which face is dimensioned.  \n- Fillets (rounded corners) vs chamfers: specify radii explicitly; when offsetting complex polylines, check for self-intersections.  \n- Document tolerances: e.g., layout tolerances for finishes vs structure; specify critical dimensions for fit-sensitive items.\n\nCaveats about the triangle angle-sum rule \u2014 should you include one?\nYes \u2014 include a short caveat. Key points to call out in your guide:\n\n- The 180\u00b0 rule holds in Euclidean (flat) geometry \u2014 i.e., for any triangle lying in a flat plane (this is what almost all building plans use). For everyday residential drafting and site plans at building scale, you can assume triangle interior angles sum to 180\u00b0.\n\n- When it may not hold (and what to watch for):\n  - Large-area geodetic/survey work: over long distances on the curved Earth, geodesic (spherical or ellipsoidal) geometry applies and triangle angle sums differ from 180\u00b0. Survey corrections or projected coordinates are used to handle this. For typical single-lot/building work this effect is negligible, but for parcel boundaries spanning many kilometers it\u2019s not.\n  - Curved surfaces: if you are measuring/laying out on a curved surface (domes, curved roofs, large-site earthworks), triangle angle sums for geodesic triangles can differ.\n  - Numerical/CAD rounding: small measurement, rounding or unit-conversion errors in CAD/survey data can make angle sums slightly off \u2014 treat tiny discrepancies (\u00b1 a few arc\u2011minutes or less) as numeric error and verify with dimension checks.\n  - 3D embedding: any triangle formed by three points in 3D space still lies in a plane; its interior angles (measured in that plane) sum to 180\u00b0. The caveat above only applies for non\u2011Euclidean surfaces or geodesic triangles.\n\nShort wording to include in your team checklist:\n- \"Triangle interior angles = 180\u00b0 (Euclidean/planar). For large-scale geodetic surveys or work on curved surfaces, use appropriate geodetic adjustments; otherwise treat small deviations as measurement/CAD rounding and investigate if they exceed expected tolerances.\"\n\nIf you want, I can format this as a one-page printable checklist for the crew (PDF-ready) or tailor it to metric or imperial conventions you use.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states the triangle interior angles sum to 180\u00b0 in the Euclidean plane and presents it as a standard rule for drafting, while only noting caveats for non-Euclidean (spherical/curved) or large-scale geodetic contexts.

The result depends on the Euclidean parallel postulate; it does NOT hold on curved surfaces (e.g., spheres or hyperbolic planes).\n- Straight sides between non\u2011collinear vertices: the triangle is formed by three non\u2011collinear points joined by straight line segments (geodesics in the plane). Degenerate case (three collinear points) gives angles 0\u00b0, 0\u00b0, 180\u00b0 as a limit.\n- Interior angles measured consistently: use the interior angle at each vertex, measured in the same units (degrees or radians) and with the usual notion of angle between two straight rays.\n- Simple triangles (non\u2011self\u2011intersecting): the usual statement applies to ordinary triangles.
