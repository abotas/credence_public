Effects if Production Has Commenced: If physical production has commenced, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to halt production.

The best primary sources are contemporaneous official documents or direct first\u2011hand statements \u2014 not memes, listicles, or anonymous blog posts.\n\nWhat to check (best-to-least reliable primary sources)\n- Funeral/crematorium records (cremation certificate or disposition permit): these typically note that cremation occurred and may record what the family did with remains. This is the single best documentary source for how the remains were handled.\n- Funeral-home paperwork and invoices (from the funeral director who handled the service): will show what the family requested and what the funeral director did.\n- Death certificate (state/county vital records): confirms death and disposition method (sometimes indicates burial vs. cremation), though it may not specify gravesite/container.\n- Probate/will records filed in county probate court: a will or instructions may state the deceased\u2019s wishes about ashes being handled or interred.\n- Contemporaneous interviews/first\u2011hand statements from immediate family members or the funeral director published at the time (news articles quoting them verbatim). These are primary if you can identify the speaker.\n- Corporate or employer statements where applicable (e.g., a press release from the company he worked for) if they contain direct information from the family or funeral director.\n- Coroner/medical examiner records if relevant (these usually cover cause of death and may include disposition).\n\nWhere to look for those sources\n- Obituaries in major newspapers (AP, New York Times, Washington Post) \u2014 start here for names of funeral home, family members, and quotes. These are often secondary but cite primary quotes and provide leads.\n- Local newspapers in the place of death (archives via local library, Newspapers.com, ProQuest, LexisNexis).\n- County vital records office for the death certificate (state law determines who can access).\n- County probate court for wills and estate files (public records).\n- Contact the funeral home named in the obituary for records or a statement (they can often confirm what the family requested).\n- Crematorium (if named) or municipal records that issue cremation permits.\n- Interview transcripts or contemporary broadcast interviews with family members or the funeral director.\n\nRed flags and source\u2011evaluation checklist (what to watch for)\n- Anonymous or unattributed claims. If a story says \u201cit\u2019s said that\u2026\u201d without naming who said it, treat it skeptically.\n- Viral memes, listicles, or social posts with no citation or only linking to other viral posts. These are tertiary and often repeat errors.\n- No contemporaneous reporting. If the only stories appear years later or are retellings, they\u2019re less reliable than reports from the time of death.\n- Lack of named first\u2011hand witnesses. The more the claim depends on unnamed \u201cfamily sources,\u201d the weaker it is.\n- Contradictory details across sources without explanation (dates, names, city). That suggests sloppy transmission of an anecdote.\n- Reliance solely on secondary or tertiary fact\u2011check sites without linking to or quoting primary documents. Fact\u2011checkers are useful, but you should still seek the underlying primary evidence for a presentation.\n- Sensational phrasing that looks like a punchline \u2014 these stories are often repeated because they\u2019re funny, not because they\u2019re documented.\n- Non\u2011authoritative \u201curban legend\u201d databases without cited primary docs. If they list sources, check those sources directly.\n\nPractical steps for the student\n1. Pull contemporaneous obituaries in reputable outlets (AP, NYT, local paper) to get names, funeral home, and quotes. These will likely give the simplest confirmation route (name of funeral home or family members).\n2. Contact the funeral home directly (phone or email). Ask whether they can confirm that the family requested part of the ashes be placed in a Pringles can and whether they have a written disposition record. Be polite and explain it\u2019s for a media\u2011literacy project; expect privacy limits.\n3. Request the death certificate from the state/county vital records office to confirm disposition field (rules vary about who can request to see more details).\n4. Check the county probate court for a will or estate file that might record final wishes.\n5. If the funeral home won\u2019t or can\u2019t confirm, rely on contemporaneous quoted family statements published in major outlets \u2014 but label those as direct quotes from family (primary testimony) in your presentation.\n\nHow to cite this responsibly in a presentation\n- If you obtain a funeral or cremation record: show it (or a redacted copy) and note the issuing office and date.\n- If relying on family quotes in mainstream obituaries: say \u201caccording to [named family member], as quoted in [Newspaper name, date].\u201d\n- If you can\u2019t get primary docs: say \u201cwidely reported and quoted at the time by [sources], who cited the family/funeral director\u201d and explain that you sought but were unable to obtain the official cremation/funeral records.\n\nSpecific note about the Pringles inventor story\n- That anecdote (Fred Baur\u2019s ashes \u2014 or a portion of them \u2014 being placed in a Pringles can) was widely reported at the time in reputable obituaries and quoted family members. Those news reports are a good starting point; the next step for airtight confirmation would be to obtain the funeral/cremation paperwork or a statement from the funeral home or immediate family.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- List the specific obituaries/articles and dates to start with,\n- Draft an email template the student can send to a funeral home or newspaper archivist,\n- Or give a short slide/text you can use in the media\u2011literacy talk showing how you evaluated sources and what you concluded.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.9, "judge1_explanation": "The model states the anecdote (Fred Baur\u2019s ashes or a portion placed in a Pringles can) 'was widely reported at the time in reputable obituaries and quoted family members,' and recommends primary records only for airtight confirmation.

They reported that Baur requested his ashes be placed in a Pringles can and that his family complied.\n2. Check brand voice and audience:\n   - If your brand is playful and irreverent, a cheeky but accurate line can work.\n   - If the brand is conservative or the audience is sensitive, choose neutral/respectful wording.\n3. Consider reputational risk:\n   - Possible backlash: being factually sloppy, appearing to mock a deceased person/family, or spreading an urban-legend tone.\n   - Mitigation: be precise, link to a source, and avoid grotesque imagery.\n4. Approve with stakeholders if needed:\n   - If the client is risk-averse, get a quick sign-off from PR/legal.\n\nExact wording options (pick one based on tone you want)\n- Accurate + viral-friendly (recommended):\n  \"Did you know?

Estates/families usually lack standing for these torts. Thus legal exposure for defamation/false light is limited.\n- Other risks: potential claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress or publicity/privacy depending on jurisdiction and how the claim is presented (especially if it\u2019s presented as an untrue, humiliating fact about a living person). More likely, the practical risk is reputational/PR \u2014 an offended family or estate could complain publicly, demand removal, or threaten other action.\n- Brand/partner risk: Even absent strong legal exposure, the claim could be seen as disrespectful or sensationalist, prompting complaints from family, negative press, or partner brand discomfort.\n\nLikelihood of complaint from family/estate\n- If the inventor is deceased and the fact is true or widely reported: low chance of legal action, but moderate chance of a reputational complaint or request to correct/withdraw language.\n- If the claim is exaggerated/false (e.g., implies whole body was \u201cburied in a can\u201d when only ashes were placed there): higher chance of complaint for inaccuracy or insensitivity.\n- Overall: moderate likelihood of a non\u2011legal complaint/request for correction; low likelihood of successful legal claim in most jurisdictions.\n\nSafer phrasing (if the fact cannot be definitively verified)\n- Avoid absolute language and sensational imagery. Attribute the claim to a source or hedge:\n  - \u201cAccording to family reports/obituaries, some of his ashes were placed in a Pringles can.\u201d\n  - \u201cReportedly, his family honored his wish to have some ashes placed in a Pringles can.\u201d\n  - \u201cMedia reports say that part of his ashes were interred in a Pringles can.\u201d\n- Prefer specific, verifiable wording to broad claims like \u201cburied in a Pringles can\u201d which can be misleading.\n- If you can verify a credible source (family statement, major news obituary), cite it on the slide (e.g., \u201cSource: New York Times obituary, 2008\u201d).\n\nRecommended next steps\n1. Verify the fact with a credible source (family statement, major obituary, archive article). If verified, use a sourced, precise statement (see examples).\n2. If you cannot verify, remove the claim or replace with a hedged attribution line.\n3. Consider running the final language past legal/PR and, if appropriate, ask the family/estate for permission to use a sensitive anecdote.\n4.

If you can give date/place or a link I can be more concrete. In the meantime, here is a practical decision framework and next steps so you can judge whether to invest further.\n\nHigh\u2011level recommendation\n- Don\u2019t commit exhibit floor space or acquisition funds yet. Do a focused verification and ethical/legal check first. If the story proves verifiable, documented, and you can secure consent/provenance, it could be a compelling object or interpretive case; if not, treat it as folklore and present it via text/media or a replica rather than an actual can containing remains.\n\nWhy verify first (key concerns)\n- Authenticity/provenance: Is the object actually what the story claims? Without a clear chain of custody you risk exhibiting a hoax or misattributed object.\n- Legal/ethical issues: Human remains (including cremated remains) are subject to laws and strong ethical norms; many jurisdictions require next\u2011of\u2011kin consent and have rules about display.\n- Conservation & health: If the can might contain ashes or hazardous residue, there are safety and conservation implications; opening or handling requires protocols.\n- Interpretive risk: The story can seem sensationalist or disrespectful if not framed carefully; public reaction may be negative.\n\nPractical verification checklist (low cost first)\n1. Identify primary details: names, dates, cemetery/funeral home, city.  \n2. Search contemporary press and obituaries (LexisNexis, ProQuest, local paper archives).  \n3. Reverse\u2011image and social media checks (Twitter/Facebook posts, Reddit threads) to trace origin.  \n4. Contact local funeral homes, cemetery offices, coroner/medical examiner (FOIA if needed) for records.  \n5. Seek affidavits/letter of provenance from current owner or family and any transfer documentation.  \n6. If you find a physical object and documentation is plausible, commission a non\u2011destructive materials/forensics consult (conservator or forensic anthropologist) for verification and safety guidance.\n\nLegal, ethical and conservation steps if it appears authentic\n- Consult your institution\u2019s legal counsel and ethics committee about displaying human remains or associated containers. Different jurisdictions have different rules.  \n- Obtain written permission from the decedent\u2019s next of kin (or demonstrate no living next of kin and follow local rules).  \n- Do not open a sealed container without appropriate permits and specialists; treat as potentially biohazardous until cleared.  \n- Get a conservator\u2019s assessment for stabilization, mounting, and display (sealed vitrine recommended).  \n- Prepare interpretive text with sensitivity, context, and content warning; avoid sensationalism.\n\nAlternatives if verification is weak or permissions unavailable\n- Use the story as a folklore case study in an exhibit on unusual burial practices, with a replica can and a panel describing the verifiable facts and the gaps.  \n- Present it as an example of contemporary mortuary folklore/DIY urns, accompanied by broader historical context about how people memorialize the dead.  \n- Include multimedia: screenshots of original social posts (with permissions), news clippings, and an analysis of how such stories spread.\n\nTime and cost estimates (rough)\n- Preliminary verification (online research, calls to local sources): days to 2 weeks, low cost (staff time).  \n- Documentary corroboration (records requests, FOIA, conservator consult): 2\u20138 weeks, modest fees.  \n- Acquisition & conservation (if authentic and accepted): variable \u2014 acquisition cost + conservation/vitrine (thousands of dollars depending on condition and treatment).\n\nDecision rule for exhibit inclusion\n- Include physical object only if: documents corroborate the story, lawful/ethical clearance and permissions are obtained, conservator signs off on safe display, and the interpretive plan addresses sensitivity.  \n- Otherwise include the story as interpretation/replica or omit.\n\nIf you want, give me the specific variant of the Pringles can story you\u2019ve found and I\u2019ll run a targeted verification plan (search list, key records to request, likely contacts).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.25, "judge1_explanation": "The model did not accept the claim as true; it asked for specifics and repeatedly treated the Pringles\u2011can burial story as unverified folklore that requires documentary and ethical checks.

That\u2019s an easy avoidable hit to credibility.\n- If you state it accurately and, ideally, attribute the source (\u201creported by the New York Times/Associated Press\u201d), the anecdote comes across as both memorable and well-researched.\n\nHow to use it (suggested wording)\n- Direct and accurate: \u201cFredric Baur, the inventor of the Pringles can, asked that part of his ashes be placed in a Pringles can after he died \u2014 and his family did, according to reports in the New York Times and the AP.

It combines a numeric confidence threshold with the concrete checks you should make before committing crew time and travel to Cincinnati to film the Pringles inventor\u2019s burial site, plus contingency recommendations.\n\nDecision rule (summary)\n- Do not book travel and full crew until the probability of obtaining usable footage at the burial site (P_success) is at or above the chosen threshold:\n  - Conservative / high-cost shoot (large crew, non\u2011refundable travel, single opportunity): require P_success \u2265 0.85 (85%).\n  - Typical documentary shoot (moderate cost, some flexibility): require P_success \u2265 0.75 (75%).\n  - Low-risk/minor cost or flexible shoot (small crew, can reassign time): require P_success \u2265 0.60 (60%).\n\nHow to calculate P_success\n- Model P_success as the product (or conservative minimum) of these independent factors:\n  P_success = P_location_correct \u00d7 P_permission \u00d7 P_accessibility \u00d7 P_weather_window \u00d7 P_crew_availability \u00d7 P_no_legal_barrier\n  where each factor is your estimated probability (0\u20131) that that element will be satisfactory for filming usable footage.\n- Example: if you estimate 0.95 (location correct) \u00d7 0.80 (permission likely) \u00d7 0.90 (accessibility) \u00d7 0.90 (weather window) \u00d7 0.95 (crew available) \u00d7 0.99 (no legal barrier) \u2192 P_success \u2248 0.57 (57%).\n\nRequired confirmations (minimum checks before you estimate probabilities)\n1. Location verification: confirm cemetery and burial details from at least two reputable sources (obituary, cemetery records, family statements, reliable press).\n2. Permission: contact cemetery management and request written permission or clear policy on filming. Get timelines and any fees.\n3. Access level: confirm whether you can get the shot you need (close-up of gravestone/marker, wide shots, interior/exterior limits); ask about vehicle access, hours, and restrictions.\n4. Permits & legal: determine if local permits are required, and whether cemetery has rules about tripods, lighting, drones.\n5. Scheduling: confirm windows when both site access and your key interviewees/crew align; check seasonal daylight/weather risk.\n6. Contingency options: identify alternatives (archival photos, interviews with family/caretaker, reenactment, B\u2011roll of Cincinnati/Pringles factory or related locations) if access is denied or limited.\n\nBooking timing and logistics\n- Decision point: set a firm go/no-go date (e.g., 10\u201314 days before travel for domestic shoots; 21\u201330 days for complex/out-of-state shoots). By that date, you should have written confirmation of permission or a sufficiently high P_success.\n- Reduce risk: if P_success is below threshold but you still need on-the-ground verification, send a local scout/fixer or hire a one\u2011person camera operator to confirm access before moving the full crew.\n- Contracts: book refundable tickets or include force\u2011majeure/cancellation flexibility where practical. Block crew time conditionally (hold dates) until confirmation.\n- Crew scaling: for borderline P_success, consider sending a minimal crew first (producer + camera) and keep full crew on standby.\n\nPractical recommended threshold for this item\n- If this shoot requires interstate travel and a multi-person crew with significant nonrecoverable costs: use the Conservative threshold (85%). If costs are moderate and you can repurpose crew time locally if filming fails, use the Typical threshold (75%).\n\nSample decision-rule clause you can paste into a schedule\n- \u201cWe will book travel and full crew for Cincinnati to film the Pringles inventor\u2019s burial site only if P_success \u2265 0.75 (75%). P_success will be computed from verified estimates for location accuracy, written cemetery permission, site accessibility, acceptable weather window, crew availability, and absence of legal restrictions. If P_success is between 0.60\u20130.75, we will dispatch a local scout/operator to confirm access; if P_success < 0.60 we will not travel and will use identified contingency assets (archives/interviews/B\u2011roll).
