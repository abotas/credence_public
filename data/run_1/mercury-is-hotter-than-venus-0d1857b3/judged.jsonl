Venus\u2019s surface is about 460\u00b0C (\u2248735 K) everywhere, while Mercury\u2019s daytime highs reach only about 420\u2013430\u00b0C and its nights fall to roughly \u2212170\u00b0C.\n\nMost decisive evidence / measurements to cite (with a one-line explanation of why each matters)\n1. Soviet Venera landers (1960s\u20131980s): direct thermometer readings from the surface of Venus of roughly 450\u2013470\u00b0C.\n   - Why decisive: these are in-situ measurements from the planet\u2019s surface \u2014 not an indirect estimate.\n2. Orbital thermal/infrared measurements and radar mapping of Venus (Pioneer Venus, Magellan, Venus Express): confirm very hot, nearly uniform surface temperatures and a dense, high-pressure atmosphere.\n   - Why decisive: they provide global temperature maps and atmospheric profiles that back up the lander data and show uniform heating.\n3. MESSENGER orbiter thermal maps of Mercury (2011\u20132015) and earlier Mariner/Messenger data: daytime surface temperatures up to ~420\u2013430\u00b0C and night lows near \u2212170\u00b0C.\n   - Why decisive: these are global measurements of Mercury\u2019s surface temperature showing large day\u2013night swings and lower peak temperatures than Venus.\n4. Planetary fact sheets from NASA/ESA summarizing these mission results (good for quick citation).\n   - Why decisive: authoritative summaries that package the primary mission data and consensus values.\n\nClear, short explanation for a general audience\n- Venus is farther from the Sun than Mercury, but it has an extremely thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid. That atmosphere traps heat very efficiently (a runaway greenhouse effect) and also produces a surface pressure about 90 times Earth\u2019s, so heat is distributed and can\u2019t escape. Mercury, by contrast, has almost no atmosphere, so its days get hot but heat radiates away at night. Result: Venus\u2019s surface sits at about 460\u00b0C everywhere, whereas Mercury\u2019s daytime maximum is lower (\u2248420\u2013430\u00b0C) and its nights are bitterly cold.\n\nTwo short soundbites you can use on-air\n- Quick: \u201cNo \u2014 Venus is the hottest planet. Direct lander readings and orbital measurements put Venus at about 460\u00b0C; Mercury\u2019s day side is a bit cooler and its nights plunge to hundreds of degrees below zero.\u201d\n- Very short: \u201cCloser to the Sun doesn\u2019t mean hotter \u2014 Venus\u2019s thick CO2 atmosphere traps heat, making it hotter than Mercury.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can give you exact mission citations and years (e.g., Venera 7/9/13/14, Pioneer Venus 1978, Magellan 1990s, Venus Express 2006\u20132014, MESSENGER 2011\u20132015) to read on-air.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.01, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that Venus is hotter than Mercury and provides specific temperature values and mission measurements supporting that claim (Venus \u2248460\u00b0C; Mercury daytime \u2248420\u2013430\u00b0C, nights \u2248\u2212170\u00b0C).

The general claim \u201cMercury is hotter than Venus\u201d is factually incorrect for surface temperatures; Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System because of its runaway greenhouse effect.\n\nWhy:  \n- Venus\u2019 surface temperature is about 735 K (\u2248462 \u00b0C).  \n- Mercury\u2019s dayside can reach \u2248700 K (\u2248427 \u00b0C) but its nightside drops to \u2248100 K (\u2248\u2212173 \u00b0C). Mercury\u2019s peak day temperature is still lower than Venus\u2019 surface temperature, and Mercury\u2019s mean/typical surface temperature is much lower.  \n\nSuggested verification / testing steps before filing the bug\n1. Check the card\u2019s exact wording and context\n   - Does the card mean \u201csurface temperature,\u201d \u201caverage temperature,\u201d \u201cdaytime temperature,\u201d or \u201catmospheric temperature at some altitude\u201d? The claim could be ambiguous. If ambiguous, that should be fixed rather than simply marked correct.\n2. Reproduce the claim with authoritative sources\n   - Lookup NASA/ESA or peer\u2011reviewed data for planet surface temperatures (example sources: NASA Solar System Exploration pages for Venus and Mercury, or planetary fact sheets).\n   - Record the specific numbers you find (e.g., Venus \u2248462 \u00b0C; Mercury range \u2212173 \u00b0C to 427 \u00b0C).\n3. Compare numbers and summarize why the card is wrong\n   - Note that Venus\u2019 global surface temperature exceeds Mercury\u2019s maximum day temperature.\n4. Inspect related content in the app\n   - Search for other cards that mention planet temperatures or comparisons to ensure consistency and catch duplicates.\n5. Verify whether the app uses a data-driven feed\n   - If temperatures are populated from a dataset, validate the dataset values and update the source if it\u2019s wrong.\n6. Prepare evidence for the bug report\n   - Capture a screenshot of the card.  \n   - Include the exact card text, device/app version, locale/language.  \n   - Attach references (links) and the specific temperature numbers you found.\n7. Propose a fix for copy\n   - Suggested replacement: \u201cVenus is the hottest planet in the Solar System \u2014 its thick CO2 atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect and keeps its surface around 462 \u00b0C (\u2248735 K), hotter than Mercury despite Mercury being closer to the Sun.\u201d  \n   - Or a shorter correction if needed: \u201cVenus is hotter than Mercury due to a strong greenhouse effect.\u201d\n8.

The scientific consensus is very strong.\n\nWhy: Venus has an extremely dense CO2 atmosphere (surface pressure \u2248 92 bar) and thick clouds that produce a runaway greenhouse effect. That traps infrared radiation and raises the surface temperature to roughly 735 K (\u2248 462 \u00b0C). These surface temperatures were directly measured by Soviet Venera landers and confirmed by subsequent missions (Pioneer Venus, Venus Express, etc.).\n\nMercury, despite being closer to the Sun, has almost no atmosphere to retain heat.

Those values come from Mariner 10, MESSENGER, and Earth-based measurements.\n\nNotes on comparisons and common confusion:\n- People sometimes assume \u201ccloser to the Sun = hotter\u201d \u2014 that neglects atmospheric effects. Venus\u2019s atmosphere makes it the hottest planet.\n- If you compare Mercury\u2019s daytime peak only, it can approach Venus\u2019s temperature but is generally a bit lower (~700 K vs ~735 K).

This is a near-global, measured surface temperature (Venera, Pioneer Venus, etc.).\n- Mercury day-side peak temperature: up to ~700 K (~427\u00b0C) at the subsolar point; night-side temperatures drop to ~100 K (about \u2212173\u00b0C).\n- Solar flux relative to Earth: Mercury ~6.7\u00d7, Venus ~1.9\u00d7. Albedo: Mercury \u22480.1\u20130.12 (dark); Venus \u22480.75 (bright clouds), so absorbed solar energy differs from raw flux.\n- Atmospheres: Venus has a very dense CO2 atmosphere (huge greenhouse effect) and strong winds that redistribute heat; Mercury essentially has no atmosphere, so temperatures vary hugely between day and night.\n\nArguments for \u201cMercury is hotter\u201d (what to emphasize)\n- Proximity to the Sun and low albedo: Mercury gets far more sunlight per unit area and absorbs a lot of it, producing very high local temperatures on the sunlit side.\n- Higher instantaneous/peak temperatures: The subsolar point on Mercury can reach temperatures comparable to \u2014 and in some measurements nearly as high as \u2014 Venus\u2019s surface, so one can argue that Mercury attains the highest point temperatures in the inner Solar System.\n- Simple physical cause: If you focus on incoming solar flux and local absorption (ignoring atmospheric effects), Mercury\u2019s closer orbit naturally makes it the hottest in terms of insolation-driven peaks.\n\nArguments for \u201cVenus is hotter\u201d (what to emphasize)\n- Global surface temperature is higher: Venus\u2019s dense CO2 atmosphere creates an extreme greenhouse effect that raises and homogenizes surface temperatures to about ~735 K everywhere; that\u2019s hotter than Mercury\u2019s typical surface except the very hottest subsolar spots.\n- Measured by landers and orbiters: Multiple missions (Venera landers, Pioneer Venus, others) directly measured the high surface temperatures on Venus. Those measurements reflect the planet\u2019s overall surface conditions.\n- Heat retention and redistribution: Venus\u2019s thick atmosphere and clouds trap heat and redistribute it, so the planet stays uniformly hot day and night, unlike Mercury\u2019s large day\u2013night swing.\n\nMeasurement and interpretation issues to use in debate\n- Peak vs. average: Be explicit whether you\u2019re comparing peak local temperatures (favors Mercury) or global/average surface temperatures (favors Venus).\n- Measurement methods: Mercury\u2019s temps come from infrared radiometry and spacecraft observations (e.g., MESSENGER); Venus\u2019s come from lander thermometers and atmospheric profiling. Different instruments, coverage, and definitions (surface vs. skin temperature) matter.\n- Time/space variability: Mercury\u2019s extreme diurnal range means \u201chotter\u201d can be true for short times/places but false as a global statement.\n\nQuick debate tips\n- If the coin says Mercury: argue peak/subsolar temps, cite proximity and low albedo, stress insolation-driven heating and show Mercury\u2019s measured ~700 K peak.\n- If the coin says Venus: argue global surface temperature and greenhouse effect, cite Venera/Pioneer Venus measurements and emphasize the ~735 K near-uniform surface temperature.\n\nIf you want, I can draft two short one-minute opening statements \u2014 one for each position \u2014 your student can use depending on the coin flip.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.02, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that \"Venus is hotter on average and at the surface overall,\" while noting Mercury only has very high local/peak temperatures on the sunlit side.
