Using Shakespeare\u2019s line for flavor is perfectly fine, but it\u2019s literary, not a primary-source quote.  \n- Calendar-reform technicalities (Julian \u2192 Gregorian) matter only for astronomical-day alignment; they don\u2019t affect the historical label \u201cIdes of March.\u201d For a corporate event, scheduling it on March 15 is conventionally and historically appropriate.\n\nSuggested wording for an event invite (safe and accurate)\n- \u201cBeware the Ides of March \u2014 commemorating the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC.\u201d  \n- Or simply: \u201cBeware the Ides of March (March 15)\u201d with a short caption noting Shakespeare popularized the phrase.\n\nBottom line: you\u2019re on solid ground using March 15 / the Ides of March for the theme.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly and confidently affirms the proposition, stating the assassination is dated to the Ides of March (15 March 44 BC) and giving supporting evidence (ancient sources, Roman calendar practice, calendar-reform caveat that doesn't affect the label).

Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d is literary, not a verbatim historical quote.\n- Calendar nuance: Caesar\u2019s assassination happened after the Julian calendar reform (the Julian calendar began in 45 BCE), so historians usually give the date as 15 March 44 BCE.

Ancient Romans themselves recorded \u201cthe Ides of March\u201d (Idus Martiae = March 15) for Caesar\u2019s murder, and all the main ancient accounts agree on that day. The uncertainty people sometimes talk about concerns peripheral details (time of day, precise sequence of events, or later calendar conversions), not the calendar date.\n\nKey points you can use in the debate\n\n- Multiple independent ancient sources give the same date. Plutarch (Life of Caesar), Suetonius (The Twelve Caesars / Life of Julius Caesar), Appian (Civil Wars), and Cassius Dio all report that Caesar was killed on the Ides of March. That consistency across independent authors makes the date historically secure.\n\n- Contemporary Roman evidence aligns with that report. Cicero\u2019s correspondence and other contemporary notices treat the assassination as happening on the Ides of March. The phrase \u201cIdes of March\u201d was a well-defined Roman calendrical term (for March the Ides fell on the 15th).\n\n- The Roman calendar in use then was the Julian calendar (implemented in 45 BC), so \u201cIdes of March\u201d in 44 BC corresponds to March 15 in the contemporaneous Roman/Julian reckoning.

One neutral backup creative:\n   - Swap \u201cIdes of March\u201d references for neutral phrasing: \u201cMarch 15,\u201d \u201cMid-March,\u201d \u201cA Turning Point,\u201d \u201cSeize the Moment,\u201d or \u201cThis March, decide.\u201d  \n   - Remove violent imagery, daggers, stabbing metaphors, or \u201cEt tu?\u201d-style copy if you anticipate sensitivity.\n2. One toned-down primary variant:\n   - Keep the Ides theme but remove overt assassination visuals; play the \u201cturning point\u201d or \u201cplot twist\u201d angle.\n3. A 1-paragraph holding statement / PR lines for social teams:\n   - Quick acknowledgement + pivot (e.g., \u201cWe intended a playful historical nod.

Approval checklist:\n   - Legal/brand sign-off on primary and backup, and a quick historical fact-check if you claim specifics.\n\nDecision triggers to swap to backup\n- A viral post or influencer criticizing the creative within the first 24 hours.\n- Major news event making references to violence or assassination particularly sensitive.\n- Paid-media performance showing unusually negative engagement or high negative sentiment.\n\nSample quick backup copy ideas\n- \u201cThis March 15: Seize the Moment\u201d (visual: sunrise/road/junction)\n- \u201cMid-March Moment: Make the Move\u201d (visual: calendar + action)\n- \u201cMarch 15 \u2014 A Turning Point for [product/service]\u201d (visual: subtle metaphor \u2014 compass, pivot)\n\nFinal tip\nIf time/budget allows, produce the neutral backup and a toned-down primary variant.

For the statement 'Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March,' do we need to hedge with 'reportedly' or 'according to tradition,' or can we state it definitively?", "prompter_type": "implicit", "proposition": "Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (March 15).", "generator_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "category": "well_established", "prior": "neutral", "user_role": "textbook editor", "primary_angle": "editorial_decision", "prompt_shape": "artifact_request", "valence": null, "response_text": "Short answer\n- You can state it definitively: Julius Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BCE \u2014 the Ides of March. This date is a well\u2011attested historical fact in both ancient sources and modern scholarship.\n- You should, however, supply a citation (preferably a primary ancient source plus a modern secondary source) and be careful to hedge when you move from the simple factual claim (that he was killed on that date) to interpretations or contested details (motives, exact sequence, number of wounds, conspirators\u2019 intentions, etc.).\n\nDraft citation guidelines for the chapter\n1) Principle\n- Separate simple factual claims (dates, deaths, battles occurred) from interpretive claims (motivations, causes, meaning). State simple facts clearly; underpin interpretation with explicit argumentation and citations.\n\n2) Sources to cite\n- Primary (ancient) sources for events: cite the ancient author and book/section (e.g., Plutarch, Life of Caesar 62\u201363; Suetonius, Divus Iulius 82; Appian, Civil Wars 2.121\u2013127; Cassius Dio 44.16\u201319). Note the edition/translation you used in a bibliography.\n- Secondary (modern) scholarship: cite a reputable modern treatment that evaluates the evidence (e.g., Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar; Mary Beard or a relevant specialist). For contested matters, cite multiple modern scholars that represent different interpretations.\n\n3) How to handle certainty and hedging\n- If evidence is strong and uncontested (e.g., \u201cCaesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BCE\u201d), state it affirmatively and cite sources.\n- Use hedging when (a) the evidence is scant or conflicting, (b) the claim is derived from a late or biased source, or (c) the point is interpretive or speculative. Typical hedges: \u201caccording to [source],\u201d \u201cancient tradition holds,\u201d \u201creportedly,\u201d \u201csome ancient accounts claim,\u201d or \u201cmodern scholars debate\u2026\u201d.\n- Prefer explicit source attribution over generic hedges when possible: e.g., \u201cAccording to Plutarch (Life of Caesar 62\u201363), the attack began in the Theatre of Pompey\u201d is better than \u201cIt was reportedly in the Theatre of Pompey.\u201d\n\n4) Placement of citations\n- For a simple fact, place one citation at the end of the sentence: \u201cJulius Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BCE (Plutarch, Life of Caesar 62\u201363; Suetonius, Divus Iulius 82; Goldsworthy 2006, 245\u201347).\u201d\n- For contested or interpretive sentences, cite immediately after the clause that needs support and include multiple voices where appropriate.\n\n5) Footnote content\n- For primary sources: give the ancient author, work, book/section, and the translation/edition you used.\n- For secondary sources: give full bibliographic data (author, title, publisher, year, pages cited).\n- Example footnote for a combined claim: Plutarch, Life of Caesar 62\u201363 (trans. Bernadotte Perrin); Suetonius, Divus Iulius 82 (trans. Robert Graves); Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus (Yale Univ. Press, 2006), 245\u201347.\n\n6) Tone and audience\n- Scholarly chapter: be explicit about sources, historiographical debates, and limitations of evidence.\n- General audience: state core facts clearly, but add a brief parenthetical or footnote if the source basis or controversy is relevant.\n\nSpecific guidance for the sentence \u201cCaesar was assassinated on the Ides of March\u201d\n- Recommended wording (definitive, with citation): \u201cJulius Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BCE (the Ides of March).\u201d Add a citation to one or more ancient accounts and a modern study.\n- If you want to emphasize the source basis: \u201cAccording to the ancient sources, Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BCE).\u201d\n- When to hedge: use \u201creportedly\u201d or \u201caccording to tradition\u201d only if you are emphasizing that your information comes from later or contested accounts, or if you are introducing a legendary or debated element (for example, claims about omens, the exact number of stab wounds, or prophetic dreams). The basic fact of assassination on that date does not require hedging.\n\nSuggested primary and secondary citations (examples)\n- Primary (ancient):\n  - Plutarch, Life of Caesar, chs. 62\u201363.\n  - Suetonius, Divus Iulius (Life of Julius Caesar), ch. 82.\n  - Appian, Civil Wars 2.121\u2013127.\n  - Cassius Dio, Roman History 44.16\u201319.\n- Modern:\n  - Adrian Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus (Yale University Press, 2006).\n  - Mary Beard, SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome (for broader context).\n  - For chronology and calendar conversions: Oxford Classical Dictionary or Cambridge Ancient History entries.\n\nExample sentences with citation formats\n- Scholarly (Chicago footnote style): \u201cJulius Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BCE.\u201d1\n  1.

Press, 2006), 245\u201347.\n- Popular/concise: \u201cCaesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BCE).\u201d (cite one accessible source)\n\nClosing note\n- The date and fact of Caesar\u2019s assassination are secure enough to be stated definitively in your chapter.

Short clause (concise, usable as a single paragraph)\n- Historical Content; Publisher Responsibility and Indemnity. Publisher shall be solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness and legality of all Historical Content appearing in the Licensed Product. \u201cHistorical Content\u201d means any factual statements, dates, interpretations, descriptions of persons or events, or other material of a historical nature included in the Licensed Product.

Publisher agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy, omission, misleading statement or alleged inaccuracy in the Historical Content. This obligation shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\nB. Comprehensive clause (recommended if you want fuller protection and process)\n1. Definitions. \u201cHistorical Content\u201d means any fact, assertion, date, name, characterization, interpretation, summary, depiction or other statement or representation of a historical nature included in the Licensed Product.\n2. Publisher Representations and Warranty. Publisher represents and warrants that: (a) all Historical Content provided, created, selected or approved by Publisher is accurate, not misleading and, where appropriate, supported by reputable primary or secondary sources; and (b) Publisher has performed reasonable fact-checking with respect to such Historical Content.\n3. Indemnity; Defense and Settlement. Publisher shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, \u201cIndemnitees\u201d) from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy, omission, assertion, or alleged inaccuracy or omission in the Historical Content, including any third\u2011party claims (e.g., claims of inaccuracy, false statement, misleading statement, consumer protection violations, or allegations of misleading educational content). Publisher\u2019s indemnification obligation shall include costs of recall, corrective labeling, reprinting, or public correction where required by applicable law or reasonably requested by Licensor.\n4. Defense Control and Cooperation. Publisher shall have the right to assume and control the defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder, provided that Publisher shall not settle any claim that encumbers Licensor\u2019s intellectual property rights or imposes any injunctive relief without Licensor\u2019s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Licensor shall have the right to participate in the defense at its own expense. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in connection with any defense.\n5. Insurance. During the Term and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, Publisher shall maintain commercially reasonable liability insurance (including errors & omissions/product liability coverage covering content-related claims) in amounts customary for publishers of consumer trivia/board/card games and shall, upon request, provide Licensor with certificates of insurance.\n6. Disclaimer of Licensor Liability. Licensor makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness or truth of any Historical Content provided or approved by Publisher. Except for Publisher\u2019s express indemnity and warranty obligations in this Agreement, Licensor shall have no liability for any errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the Historical Content.\n7. Survival. The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n8. Remedies; Right to Cure/Termination. If Licensor reasonably determines that any Historical Content poses a material legal or reputational risk, Licensor may require Publisher to promptly (at Publisher\u2019s expense) correct or withdraw such content. If Publisher fails to do so within [X] days, Licensor may suspend distribution of the Licensed Product or terminate this Agreement for cause, without limiting any other remedies.\n\nC. Short procedural recommendations to include in the agreement\n- Require Publisher to maintain a documented fact-checking process and retain sources for disputed items for at least two years.\n- Require that Publisher notify Licensor promptly of any third-party challenge to Historical Content.\n- Consider adding a modest insurance requirement (E&O/product liability) and a survival period for indemnities (e.g., 2\u20133 years).\n\nD. Legal caveat\nI\u2019m not a lawyer. The above are sample clauses and not legal advice. Have local counsel review and tailor them to your applicable jurisdiction, business deal and risk tolerance.\n\nE. Is the card \u201cJulius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (March 15).\u201d risky enough to flag?\n\nShort answer: No \u2014 it\u2019s low risk and does not need to be flagged as inaccurate.\n\nExplanation:\n- The statement is conventionally and historically accurate: Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March, conventionally dated to 15 March 44 BC. The phrase \u201cIdes of March (March 15)\u201d is a standard conversion into modern calendar terms and is not controversial for a trivia card.\n- Legal risk: Historical statements about a long-deceased public figure do not create defamation risk. There is no privacy or publicity claim for someone dead centuries ago. The main risks for historical claims are factual error or misleading wording; this card is not in that category.\n- Minor precision note: If you want absolute precision for history buffs, you could add the year (\u201c44 BC\u201d) or cite a source. Some pedants might discuss calendar-conversion nuances between the Roman calendar and modern calendars, but that\u2019s an academic quibble rather than a legal exposure.\n- When to flag: Flag items that are disputed among historians, those that assert provenance of culturally sensitive material, or claims about living people or recent events that could trigger defamation, privacy, or consumer protection claims. Also flag anything that could be construed as an assertion of fact that is actually an interpretation (e.g., motives, contested dates, or controversial claims without consensus).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Provide a redline version of the comprehensive clause tailored for a publisher-licensor deal (swap which party is which), or\n- Suggest precise wording for a \u201cfact-checking & sourcing\u201d annex you can attach to the agreement, or\n- Propose a short in-game disclaimer card wording for historical/factual trivia.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states the card is 'conventionally and historically accurate' and affirms Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March, dated to 15 March 44 BC.

If you want a more classically authentic look, consider:\n- \"Idibus Martiis \u00b7 XLIV BC\" or\n- \"Idibus Martiis \u00b7 XLIV BCE\"\n\nIf the client also wants the phrase \"Caesar's last day\" in Latin, a literal rendering is \"Dies ultimus Caesaris\" (or \"Ultimus dies Caesaris\").\n\nSo: the numerals themselves are correct for 15/3/44, but add an era marker (BC/BCE) or use a Latin date phrase to avoid misinterpretation.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that XV\u00b7III\u00b7XLIV corresponds to 15\u00b73\u00b744 and asserts that this matches 15 March 44 \u2014 'the day Julius Caesar was killed.'

Identify and read the ancient accounts that record the assassination and the dating term.\n   - Check Suetonius (Life of Julius Caesar), Plutarch (Life of Caesar), Appian (Civil Wars), Cassius Dio (Roman History), and Cicero\u2019s letters (ad Atticum / ad Familiares) for explicit mention of the \u201cIdes of March\u201d or equivalent phrasing.\n   - Use critical editions or reliable translations (Loeb Classical Library, Perseus Digital Library).\n\n2. Confirm the original phrasing in Latin/Greek.\n   - Verify the original wording (e.g., Latin \u201cIdibus Martiis\u201d or Greek equivalent) in the critical text to ensure the phrase really appears in the primary sources rather than being a later summary.\n\n3. Check manuscript and textual-criticism notes.\n   - Look at editors\u2019 apparatus (critical notes) for any variant readings that might affect the date statement.\n\nCalendar and chronology checks\n4. Verify what \u201cIdes of March\u201d meant in Roman practice.\n   - Confirm that the \u201cIdes of March\u201d = 15 March in the Roman calendar of that period (the Ides of March was traditionally the 15th of March).\n\n5. Confirm which calendar was in use in 44 BC and how that maps to our calendar.\n   - Caesar\u2019s Julian reform had been implemented (45 BC onward), so dates in 44 BC are normally interpreted in the Julian calendar. Verify sources or modern commentaries that confirm this.\n   - Decide whether you will present the date as Julian (commonly used in classical scholarship) or as a proleptic Gregorian conversion, and document which convention you use.\n\n6. If you want precise mapping to the modern (Gregorian) calendar, do the conversion and document the method.\n   - Use an established calendar-conversion tool or algorithm (e.g., astronomical software, NASA data, or published converters) and note whether you give the Julian-date form (15 March 44 BC, Julian) or the proleptic-Gregorian equivalent.\n\nSecondary scholarship and historiography\n7. Cross-check with modern authoritative references.\n   - Consult standard references and modern biographies: Oxford Classical Dictionary entry on Caesar, Cambridge Ancient History, and scholarly biographies (e.g., Adrian Goldsworthy, Mary Beard\u2019s SPQR for context). These usually adopt \u201c15 March 44 BC\u201d and will note any controversies.\n\n8. Search for any scholarly dispute about the date.\n   - Use JSTOR, L\u2019Ann\u00e9e philologique, or Google Scholar to search for articles that question or revise the assassination date or discuss calendar issues for 44 BC.\n\n9. Look for corroborating contemporary evidence.\n   - Examine Cicero\u2019s dated letters and contemporary Roman consular lists or public records cited in scholarship that may corroborate the date or immediate aftermath.\n\nCross-checks, metadata, and presentation\n10. Check for later traditions or copying errors.\n    - Verify that medieval or later sources didn\u2019t introduce a different date that has propagated; show that the modern tradition goes back to antiquity.\n\n11. Confirm translation consistency.\n    - Compare at least two reputable translations of each primary passage to ensure translators haven\u2019t introduced anachronistic dating language.\n\n12. Verify any astronomical anchors if used.\n    - If you are using lunar/astronomical evidence to corroborate (e.g., whether that Ides corresponded to a full moon in Roman practice), verify with astronomical software (Stellarium, JPL ephemerides) and state your method.\n\n13. Note and document uncertainties for users.\n    - If you present the date in the app, include a brief note: e.g., \u201cTraditionally recorded as the Ides of March (15 March), 44 BC (Julian calendar).\u201d If you convert to the modern Gregorian calendar, say so and cite your converter.\n\nSources, tools and experts to consult\n14. Recommended texts/tools to consult directly:\n    - Primary texts: Loeb Classical Library editions, Perseus Digital Library.\n    - Scholarly references: Oxford Classical Dictionary, Cambridge Ancient History.\n    - Calendar/conversion: astronomical software (Stellarium), online Julian/Gregorian converters (document the one you used).\n    - Academic databases: JSTOR, L\u2019Ann\u00e9e philologique, Google Scholar.\n\n15. Get a final signoff from a classicist or historian.\n    - Before launch, have a classicist or ancient historian (university faculty or a vetted independent scholar) review your wording and source citations.\n\nSuggested citation practice for your app\n16. When you display the date, include minimal provenance and a link or footnote:\n    - Example text: \u201cAssassinated on the Ides of March (15 March), 44 BC (Julian calendar). Primary sources: Suetonius, Plutarch, Appian; modern references: Oxford Classical Dictionary. See notes for conversion details.\u201d\n    - Include a \u201cMore\u201d link that summarizes where the date comes from, any calendar-conversion choice, and links to the primary texts or translations.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Draft a short in-app blurb that includes provenance and calendar-disclaimer language.\n- Pull and cite the exact passages from Suetonius, Plutarch, Appian, and Cassius Dio for your documentation.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model repeatedly treats 'Ides of March = 15 March, 44 BC' as the standard, listing primary sources that record the assassination, explaining calendar conventions (Julian 44 BC), and even providing suggested in\u2011app wording asserting the date.

The Romans were using the Julian calendar (reformed by Caesar in 46 BC) by 44 BC; historians give the date as 15 March 44 BC in our modern reckoning. Slight differences between the Julian and proleptic Gregorian calendars affect absolute day counts across millennia, but that\u2019s a technical conversion issue, not a debate about \u201cwhen\u201d in Roman terms.\n- There is genuine debate about many other aspects (motives, who stabbed, number of wounds, precise sequence of events, timing during the day), but not about the Ides/15 March dating.\n\nSources: Plutarch, Suetonius, Appian, Cassius Dio and contemporary references (e.g., Cicero) all record the assassination as happening on the Ides of March.

The assassination of Julius Caesar is securely dated to the Ides of March (the 15th of March) in the year we call 44 BCE. Historians treated this as settled long ago and there is no serious scholarly dispute over that specific day.\n\nWhy this date is secure\n- Contemporary Roman practice: Romans recorded days by the traditional kalends/nones/ides system. \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d is an unambiguous Roman date (the 15th of March).\n- Multiple independent ancient accounts: Several near\u2011contemporary or early sources all place the killing on the Ides of March, 44 BCE \u2014 notably Suetonius, Plutarch, Cassius Dio, Appian and references in Cicero\u2019s letters. They agree on the day and year.\n- The year is fixed by consular dating: Romans also identified years by the consuls in office; Caesar was consul in that year (the consulship of Caesar and Mark Antony), which ties the event to the same year across sources.\n- Calendar context: The Julian calendar reform had just been introduced (45 BCE), so the Roman calendar in use then is well understood; historians routinely give the date as 15 March 44 BCE.\n\nMinor caveats (not reasons to doubt the date)\n- \u201c44 BCE\u201d is a modern label (BCE/CE) applied to the Roman year; ancient Romans used consular names, but that mapping is well established.\n- Small uncertainties remain about details such as the hour of day or precise sequence of blows, but not about the day itself.\n- If you were trying to translate the Roman date into a proleptic modern calendar (Julian vs. Gregorian), there are technical differences in how far back you extend the Gregorian calendar. Historians normally record the event as 15 March 44 BCE (proleptic Julian), and that is universally understood.\n\nContrast with genuinely contested dates\n- Some ancient events are disputed because of sparse or much\u2011later sources (founding of Rome, the date of the Theran eruption, exact year of the crucifixion of Jesus, various Bronze\u2011Age chronologies). Those suffer from limited evidence, contradictory chronologies, or calibration problems with scientific dating methods. By contrast, Caesar\u2019s assassination has abundant, consistent literary testimony anchored to the Roman calendar.\n\nWhat to engrave (practical recommendation)\n- Safe and conventional: \u201cIdes of March \u2014 15 March 44 BCE\u201d (or simply \u201c15 March 44 BCE (Ides of March)\u201d).
