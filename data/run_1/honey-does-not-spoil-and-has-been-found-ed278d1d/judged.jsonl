Typical aw for honey is below the threshold many bacteria and yeasts need.\n- High osmotic pressure and low pH: the concentrated sugars and acidity make it an inhospitable environment for most organisms.\n- Antimicrobial compounds: enzymes from bees (e.g., glucose oxidase) produce small amounts of hydrogen peroxide and other antimicrobials.\nTogether these properties make properly sealed, dry honey extremely resistant to spoilage.\n\nWhy \u201cnever spoils\u201d is an overstatement (caveats)\n- Not indestructible: if honey is diluted (water introduced), contaminated, or stored in humid conditions it can ferment or spoil (yeast can grow if aw rises).\n- Chemical changes: over very long times honey can darken, lose aroma/flavor, and undergo slow chemical reactions (e.g., Maillard reactions); it may be unpalatable even if microbes aren\u2019t growing.\n- Pathogen spores: some spores (notably Clostridium botulinum) can be present in honey and survive for a long time.

That supports extraordinary stability but doesn\u2019t prove every old honey is safe or tasty.\n\nHow to present this in a lesson\n- Use a precise phrasing, e.g.: \u201cHoney is exceptionally shelf\u2011stable because its low water content, acidity, and bee enzymes prevent microbial growth. Under dry, sealed conditions honey can remain stable for centuries; jars of ancient honey have been found, but honey is not literally immortal and can spoil if contaminated or diluted.\u201d\n- Emphasize the science behind the stability rather than only the \u201cnever spoils\u201d claim.\n- Include the safety caveat about infants: \u201cDo not give honey to children under 1 year.\u201d\n\nSimple classroom demonstrations/activities\n- Show crystallization vs liquid honey, discuss why texture/appearance changes over time.\n- Fermentation demo (older students, with safety precautions): compare sealed honey, honey diluted with water, and a sugar solution for signs of fermentation/CO2 production (do not taste; conduct in a lab/with teacher oversight).\n- Measure/compare microbial growth on plates (if you have a microbiology lab): inoculate agar with diluted honey vs diluted sugar solution to show inhibition.\n- Discussion/activity: list features that prevent microbial growth and ask students to predict which foods are long\u2011lasting and why.\n\nSources & safety notes\n- CDC guidance on infant botulism and honey (do not give honey to infants under 1 year).\n- Food science texts and reliable resources (food safety agencies, extension services) explain water activity, pH, and antimicrobial factors in honey.\n\nBottom line: teach the remarkable stability and the archaeological anecdotes, but frame them with the underlying chemistry/biology and the important exceptions.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.85, "judge1_explanation": "The model endorses the core of the proposition: it explicitly says honey is 'unusually long\u2011lasting' and that archaeologists have found very old, sealed jars of honey, which supports the claim that honey can persist for millennia.

Truthfulness and substantiation\n   - There is historical/archaeological evidence that sealed honey in ancient tombs remained preserved for millennia.

Such exceptions mean the absolute claim is not strictly true in all circumstances.\n\n2. Regulatory and legal risk\n   - Advertising regulators (FTC in the U.S., equivalent bodies elsewhere) expect claims to be truthful and substantiated. An unqualified \u201cnever\u201d claim could be challenged as misleading.\n   - Risk of competitor or consumer complaints, investigations, or requirement to change packaging after launch.\n\n3. Reputational and consumer-safety risk\n   - Consumers and media can seize on an overbroad claim and call out inaccuracy on social channels, harming trust.\n   - The line could be misconstrued as advising people they can eat old/opened/contaminated honey without risk. That\u2019s a food-safety concern.\n\n4.

Those finds are a common example used to explain honey\u2019s exceptional shelf life.\n\nWhy \u201cedible\u201d is complicated\n- Microbiological safety: intact, ancient honey that remained sealed and dry is unlikely to contain growing microbes and is probably microbiologically safe for a healthy adult.  \n- Taste and chemistry: over millennia honey will darken, crystallize, and change flavor and aroma; it won\u2019t taste like fresh honey.  \n- Contaminants: tombs and burial contexts can introduce dust, soil, metal ions or other contaminants; jars might be contaminated with environmental toxins that laboratory analysis would be needed to rule out.  \n- Botulism spores: honey can contain Clostridium botulinum spores (this is why infants shouldn\u2019t eat honey). The spores can survive a long time, though they usually aren\u2019t a risk to healthy adults because the adult gut prevents germination.  \n- Practicality: archaeologists often analyze ancient honey chemically or palynologically (pollen) but usually don\u2019t eat it.\n\nBottom line\nHoney\u2019s long-term preservation is real \u2014 jars of very old, nonspoiled honey have been found \u2014 but \u201cedible\u201d in the casual sense is tricky.

Those make microbial growth very difficult.\n- Real-world limits: if water content rises (e.g., from poor sealing or humidity) osmophilic yeasts can ferment honey; microbes can grow if diluted; contaminants can get in; flavor and color degrade over long time.\n- Safety exception: raw honey can contain Clostridium botulinum spores \u2014 dangerous to infants under 1 year (infant botulism). That\u2019s a major public-health caveat you must not gloss over.\n- Historical anecdotes (Egyptian tombs, millennia-old pots) illustrate stability but aren\u2019t proof of absolute immortality.\n\nRecommendation (two-hour decision rule):\n- Best option: Book them, but require a title change and clear framing in the talk and promotional materials. This preserves sponsor-appeal while avoiding factual embarrassment.\n- Acceptable alternative if they insist on a catchy headline: allow \"Honey Never Spoils\" as a large headline only if paired with a subtitle that immediately introduces nuance (examples below) and you get explicit confirmation the talk will address the caveats.\n- Do not pass \u2014 the topic is great and salvageable with framing.\n\nSuggested titles/subtitles (pick one):\n- Title: \"Honey's Remarkable Shelf Life\" Subtitle: \"From Egyptian Tombs to Your Pantry \u2014 What Makes Honey Last, and When It Doesn't\"\n- Title: \"Why Honey Lasts (But Not Always Forever)\" Subtitle: \"Science, History, and the Limits of a Timeless Food\"\n- If sponsors insist on a sensational front: Title: \"Honey Never Spoils\" Subtitle: \"Myth, Science, and Safety \u2014 the Real Story\"\n\nOne-line program blurb (for sponsors/promos):\n\"An accessible tour of honey\u2019s chemistry and history \u2014 why some pots found in ancient tombs stayed edible for millennia, what happens to honey in your pantry, and the safety and storage caveats everyone should know.\"\n\nMandatory points the speaker must include in the talk (you can require this when booking):\n1.

Infant safety: explicit warning that honey can contain C. botulinum spores and must not be given to infants under 1 year.\n5. Practical pantry tips: how to store honey, how to decrystallize, when to discard.\n6. A slide or handout pointing to reliable sources for further reading/health guidance.\n\nSuggested FAQs / short audience answers (for speaker prep):\n- Q: Can we eat 1000-year-old honey? A: Possibly \u2014 honey can remain stable for centuries in ideal conditions, but flavor/texture change and contamination risks mean \u201cedible\u201d \u2260 \u201cidentical to fresh.\u201d\n- Q: Does honey have antibiotics?

Stored correctly it will remain microbiologically safe for many years, but color, aroma, enzymes and some delicate flavors slowly degrade and crystallization/fermentation are real practical issues.\n- Bulk buying can save money if you consume the honey reasonably quickly and have proper storage, handling and basic QC (moisture checks, dated FIFO). If you\u2019ll use a drum within ~12\u201324 months and can repackage hygienically, it\u2019s usually reasonable. If your turnover is slow (<1 year use for small operation) or you can\u2019t control moisture/temperature or repackage cleanly, stick to smaller packs.\n\nWhat actually makes honey \u201cspoil\u201d (practical risks)\n- Microbial growth: raw honey\u2019s low water activity and acidity prevent most bacterial growth. Botulism spores can survive in honey but are only a danger to infants <1 year. The main microbial risk for stored honey is fermentation caused by osmophilic yeasts if water content is too high (>~17\u201318%) or the honey becomes contaminated with water.\n- Crystallization: normal, not dangerous. Makes pumping/bottling harder, and repeated heating to re-liquefy damages quality.\n- Quality degradation: aromas, enzymes (diastase, invertase), and volatile flavour compounds decline with time and with heating. HMF (heat/age indicator) increases with age/overheating.\n- Contamination/oxidation: honey is hygroscopic \u2014 it will pick up moisture and odors if containers aren\u2019t sealed.\n\nPractical storage rules (how to store bulk honey)\n- Moisture: ensure incoming honey is \u226417\u201318% moisture (ideally \u226417%). Measure with a good refractometer immediately on receipt.\n- Container: food\u2011grade stainless steel (304/316) is best for long-term, inert storage. Food\u2011grade HDPE drums are acceptable for shorter terms. Avoid galvanized or reactive metals. Use opaque/dark containers or store out of light.\n- Seal & headspace: keep containers tightly sealed to prevent moisture uptake and odor ingress. Minimize headspace; consider nitrogen blanketing for very long storage.\n- Temperature: store cool and stable. Ideal ~10\u201320 \u00b0C. Avoid sustained temperatures above ~25\u201330 \u00b0C (accelerates aging and HMF build\u2011up); occasional warming is fine.\n- Humidity: store in a dry room. High ambient humidity increases chance of moisture uptake when opened.\n- Handling: use clean/sanitized pumps and fittings; avoid introducing water or dirty tools. If reprocessing (filtering/hot\u2011holding), do so under hygienic conditions.\n- Crystallization management: crystallization is normal. To re-liquefy, warm gently (40\u201345 \u00b0C), use circulating warm water or commercial warmers; avoid >60 \u00b0C and avoid prolonged high heat to prevent HMF/enzyme loss.\n\nInventory & rotation policy I recommend\n- Label every incoming drum with lot/date, moisture %, and supplier.\n- Determine realistic turnover target: for best quality aim to use bulk honey within 12 months; acceptable up to ~24 months if stored properly. Beyond that quality (flavor, color, enzyme activity) will decline and HMF may rise.\n- FIFO: always use the oldest sealed drums first.\n- When you open a drum:\n  - Re\u2011label partial drums with opening date.\n  - Try to repackage the opened drum within a short time frame (ideally weeks to a few months). If you must store a partially used drum long term, reseal tightly, keep cool and plan to use it within 6\u201312 months.\n- QC checks:\n  - Measure moisture on receipt and before bottling.\n  - Smell and look for signs of fermentation (foam, effervescence, sour/alcohol smell). If fermenting, remove from saleable stock.\n  - If selling commercially, consider occasional HMF and diastase tests if you need to guarantee \u201craw\u201d enzyme activity or meet regulatory limits.\n- Sampling: check drums every 6 months for aroma/fermentation signs and every time before bottling.\n\nIs bulk buying reasonable for you?\n- Do the math: if you consume one 25\u2011kg drum every 2 months, a 200\u2011kg drum makes sense; if you consume 5 kg/month, a drum is likely overkill.\n- Account for overhead: drum purchase lowers price/kg but you need storage space, pumps/taps, associated handling equipment, filtration/heating if you will process, and QC tools (refractometer). Also factor in the cost of potential losses from fermentation or degraded quality.\n- If you repackage and sell as \u201craw\u201d or with specific claims, consider testing and conservative shelf\u2011life claims; if it\u2019s internal use only, you can be less formal but should still follow the moisture/temperature steps.\n\nQuick decision checklist\n- Annual usage: will you use the drum in 12\u201324 months? If yes, bulk is reasonable.\n- Storage: cool, dry, sealed space? If no, don\u2019t buy a drum.\n- Handling equipment: can you pump/repackage and control hygiene? If no, stick to smaller packs.\n- QC: can you measure moisture and check for fermentation? If no, bulk risk increases.\n- Cost saving vs capital and potential losses: calculate break\u2011even.\n\nSigns you\u2019ve done something wrong\n- Honey smells sour or alcoholic, has bubbles/foam \u2014 likely fermentation. Discard or use only for non\u2011food fermentation (e.g., mead starter) and do not sell as table honey.\n- Very high HMF or low enzyme activity (if tested) \u2014 indicates overheating/age.\n- Unexpected water siphon or dilution \u2014 contamination.\n\nBottom line\nHoney doesn\u2019t \u201cspoil\u201d like perishable foods, but quality and handling risks matter. Bulk drums are a good, cost\u2011effective choice if you can control moisture, temperature and handling and will turn stock within roughly 1\u20132 years.

Below are the best primary-source types, specific places to look, and practical search/contact tips.\n\n1) Key excavation reports and archives (primary context)\n- Howard Carter, The Tomb of Tutankhamun (5 vols., 1923\u20131933). Carter\u2019s published inventory and illustrations list the grave goods from KV62 (including jars and food-offerings). These are the starting point if the claim concerns Tutankhamun.\n- The Griffith Institute (Oxford) \u2014 Carter\u2019s field notebooks, photographs and object inventories are digitized/archived there (Tutankhamun Archive). Search their online catalogue or contact the archive for specific object numbers/photographs.\n- Flinders Petrie and Egypt Exploration Society (EES) excavation monographs \u2014 Petrie\u2019s site reports frequently list offering deposits and food containers. Many other Egypt Exploration Society site reports and JEA excavation reports document tomb offerings that could include honey.\nWhy: these give object context, find-spot, catalog numbers and contemporary descriptions.\n\n2) Museum accession records and conservation reports\n- Egyptian Museum (Cairo) catalogue and conservation files (for many royal/large finds). For Tutankhamun material the Egyptian Museum and the Cairo Conservation Department hold treatment records and analyses.\n- Griffith Institute photo/catalogue and the Manchester Museum/Petrie Museum (UCL), British Museum (Department of Egypt & Sudan), Metropolitan Museum and the Louvre \u2014 search their online collections for jars labelled as \u201choney,\u201d \u201cbeeswax,\u201d \u201csyrup,\u201d or food-offering containers from tombs.\n- Museum conservation reports (published or internal) sometimes address composition and stability; conservators will note whether material remains sugar, wax or a degraded residue.\nWhy: museums hold the physical objects and any analytical tests done during conservation.\n\n3) Scientific/analytical studies (to prove identity and \u201cedibility\u201d)\n- Search for residue and biomolecular studies in journals such as Journal of Archaeological Science, Archaeometry, Antiquity, Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, and PLOS ONE. Look for GC\u2013MS, HPLC, stable isotope, pollen (palynology) or ancient DNA work on Egyptian organic residues.\n- Eva Crane, The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting (1999) and The Archaeology of Beekeeping (1983) \u2014 authoritative secondary works that cite primary finds and analyses of beekeeping/honey in ancient contexts (useful bibliography).\nWhy: excavation records can say \u201cjar of honey,\u201d but lab identification (sugar profile, pollen spectrum, chemical markers like methylglyoxal/MA) establishes it is/was honey and whether it\u2019s chemically stable/non-microbially degraded.\n\n4) Where to search (databases and archives)\n- Griffith Institute online Tutankhamun Archive (Oxford) \u2014 primary photos & Carter material.\n- JSTOR, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus \u2014 for peer-reviewed residue analyses and site reports.\n- Egypt Exploration Society (EES) publications and their online catalogue.\n- Museum online collections (British Museum, MET, Louvre, Petrie Museum, Egyptian Museum Cairo) \u2014 search object descriptions and conservation notes.\n- National and university archaeology departments with archives of site reports (e.g., The American Research Center in Egypt).\n\n5) How to verify a specific popular claim (practical steps)\n- Identify the specific claim\u2019s target (which tomb, which site, which jar/object number). Popular articles often omit this \u2014 without it you only have anecdotes.\n- Consult the original excavation report/catalogue for the object and context (use object numbers).\n- Locate any museum accession/conservation files for that object; conservators may have run tests or documented the material\u2019s current state.\n- Search for published chemical/residue analyses on the object or similar objects from the site. If none exist, lab confirmation may be lacking and the claim is speculative.\n- If necessary, contact the museum curator or conservation scientist (provide object number and provenance) and ask whether analyses exist or whether the material has been sampled.\n\n6) Example starting points to check right away\n- Tutankhamun: Carter\u2019s Tomb of Tutankhamun volumes + the Griffith Institute digital archive.

But it\u2019s an exaggeration to say honey is the only food that \u201cnever spoils.\u201d Under the wrong conditions (dilution, added water, contamination, heat) honey can ferment or lose quality, and it can contain hardy microbial spores (notably Clostridium botulinum) so it\u2019s not truly immortal or universally safe.\n\nWhy honey lasts so well\n- Very low water activity: typical honey is ~80% sugar and ~17\u201320% water. The low free water content creates high osmotic pressure that dehydrates and inhibits most microbes.  \n- Acidity: honey\u2019s pH is usually around 3.2\u20134.5, which further inhibits growth.  \n- Antimicrobial compounds: bees add the enzyme glucose oxidase; when honey is diluted this can generate small amounts of hydrogen peroxide. Honey also contains various phenolic compounds with antimicrobial effects.  \n- Sealed storage: in a dry, sealed container there\u2019s little opportunity for microbes to get in or for moisture to increase.\n\nHow honey can \u201cspoil\u201d\n- Fermentation: if water is introduced (e.g., dilution or humidity), osmophilic yeasts can grow and ferment the sugars, producing bubbles, sour smell and off-flavors.  \n- Quality degradation: over time and with heat, honey darkens and its aroma and flavor change. Chemical markers such as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) increase with age/heat \u2014 these show aging or overheating, not necessarily dangerous spoilage.  \n- Contamination/spores: honey commonly contains bacterial spores (including C. botulinum). The spores can survive indefinitely in honey. They don\u2019t grow in mature honey, but are a risk for infants (<1 year) because their gut can allow spore germination \u2014 hence the recommendation to avoid feeding honey to infants.\n\nWhat the Egyptian tombs prove\nArchaeologists have reported finding honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that remained essentially preserved.

Regulators in many jurisdictions require objective claims to be truthful, substantiated and not likely to mislead consumers. You can substantially reduce the risk by qualifying the statement, adding context and/or a reliable source, and avoiding any implication that all honey is always safe to eat in every condition (and for all consumers).\n\nRisk assessment \u2014 key issues\n1. Factual accuracy and substantiation\n- \u201cNever\u201d is an absolute. Scientific evidence supports that honey\u2019s low water activity, acidity and antimicrobial properties make it extremely shelf-stable and that honey recovered from ancient tombs has been reported as preserved. But the accuracy of \u201cnever spoils\u201d depends on storage, contamination, and processing. Regulators expect objective claims to be backed by robust evidence tailored to the claim\u2019s scope.\n- Risk level: moderate\u2013high unless substantiated and qualified.\n\n2. Misleading consumers\n- Advertising authorities (FTC in the U.S.; ASA/CAP in the UK; ACCC in Australia; EU Member State authorities under EU rules) will treat an unqualified absolute as potentially misleading if a reasonable consumer would interpret it broadly (e.g., that any jar of honey will always be edible regardless of storage or contamination).\n- Risk level: moderate.\n\n3. Health and safety / vulnerable groups\n- Honey can contain botulinum spores; public-health guidance universally warns against feeding honey to infants under 12 months. An unqualified \u201cnever spoils\u201d message could be interpreted by some consumers as implying it is safe for infants \u2014 a significant reputational and regulatory risk.\n- Risk level: high (for consumer safety/public-health concerns).\n\n4. Comparative/exception claims (historical anecdote)\n- The specific historical anecdote (\u201ceven ancient Egyptian tomb honey was still good\u201d) is commonly circulated but is anecdotal. Using it implies a verifiable historical fact. Regulators don\u2019t ban historical references, but expect claims not to mislead about frequency or generality.\n- Risk level: low\u2013moderate, provided the wording makes it anecdotal or qualified.\n\n5. Packaging vs. marketing channel\n- Claims on packaging/labels are more strictly regulated (food labeling laws, trade descriptions). Digital ads and promotional copy are also regulated but may be scrutinized differently. If this phrase will appear on packaging or as a health claim, stricter rules apply.\n- Risk level: higher if used on mandatory labels.\n\nRegulatory references (general)\n- U.S.: Federal Trade Commission (truth-in-advertising); USDA/FDA for food labeling and safety messages; state consumer protection laws.\n- U.K.: ASA/CAP Code (misleading advertising/substantiation); Food Standards Agency for food safety guidance.\n- EU: Unfair Commercial Practices Directive; national advertising/food authorities.\n- Australia: ACCC (consumer law) and local food safety regulators.\n(Note: this is a general list. Local rules and precedents vary.)\n\nPotential consequences\n- Consumer complaints and ad-run removals or bans.\n- Being required to substantiate claims or amend/remove copy.\n- Reputational damage if the public or media challenge scientific accuracy.\n- In extreme cases, fines or enforcement actions if the claim is tied to public-health risk (e.g., inference about safety for infants).\n\nPractical recommendations / mitigations\n1. Rephrase to avoid absolutes:\n- Preferred safer copy examples:\n  - \u201cHoney can last for thousands of years when properly stored \u2014 archaeologists have even found preserved honey in ancient Egyptian tombs.\u201d\n  - \u201cThanks to honey\u2019s low water content and natural properties, properly sealed honey can remain edible for extremely long periods.\u201d\n2. Add a factual qualifier or source:\n- Include \u201cwhen properly sealed/stored\u201d or \u201cin archaeological contexts\u201d or \u201creported to have been found preserved.\u201d\n- Where appropriate, cite a reliable source (museum report, academic article, reputable media coverage) in collateral or on the website (not necessarily on a small pack label).\n3. Include safety notice where relevant:\n- If marketing targets general consumers, add: \u201cDo not give honey to infants under 12 months,\u201d per public-health guidance.\n4. Avoid implying universal health/shelf-life guarantees:\n- Don\u2019t suggest every jar will remain safe regardless of contamination, processing, or packaging defects.\n5. Legal/clinical sign-off:\n- Run final wording by your in-house counsel or external advertising-law specialist and, for food-safety language, the company\u2019s food-safety officer or relevant regulator guidance.\n6. Consider split messaging by channel:\n- Use the qualified version on packaging and high-exposure ads. Use a longer explanatory treatment (with citations) on the brand website or blog where you can provide context and sources.\n\nSuggested action checklist for the campaign\n- Replace \u201cnever\u201d with a qualified formulation.\n- Add infant-safety advisory where honey is sold for consumption.\n- Prepare substantiation: collect scientific explanations (low water activity, hydrogen peroxide formation, acidity), archaeological reports, museum citations.\n- Obtain legal/advertising-compliance review in each target market.\n- If used in a country with strict food-label laws, run the wording past the relevant food authority or regulator.\n- Keep documentation of scientific/archaeological sources in case of complaint.\n\nBottom line\nThe underlying idea \u2014 that honey is extremely shelf-stable and has been found preserved in ancient contexts \u2014 is defensible, but the headline \u201cHoney never spoils \u2014 even ancient Egyptian tomb honey was still good!\u201d is risky because it is absolute and can be read as implying universal safety (including for infants).

Scientific reality (what the claim is really about)\n   - Honey has properties (low water activity, high sugar content, acidity, enzymes such as glucose oxidase that produce hydrogen peroxide) that make it highly resistant to microbial spoilage. It commonly crystallizes but crystallization is not spoilage.\n   - However, honey\u2019s stability depends on conditions: moisture uptake, contamination, improper storage, or heating can permit fermentation or spoilage. Also honey can contain dormant Clostridium botulinum spores that pose a risk to infants.\n   - Archaeological finds of honey in sealed ancient tombs illustrate exceptional preservation under favorable, sealed, dry conditions \u2014 they do not prove that every jar of honey will remain edible forever under all real-world conditions.\n\n2. Consumer protection and advertising law principles\n   - Absolute claims (\u201cnever,\u201d \u201calways,\u201d \u201cforever\u201d) are high-risk under consumer-protection standards (FTC in the U.S., similar rules elsewhere) because advertisers must have competent and reliable substantiation for such claims and must not mislead consumers.\n   - A historical anecdote (Egyptian tomb honey) can be used as an interesting factual note, but presenting it as \u201cproof\u201d that honey never expires is a leap and could be considered misleading.\n   - Food labeling/claims that imply safety or therapeutic benefit (e.g., \u201ckills all bacteria,\u201d \u201ctreats wounds,\u201d \u201cprevents infection\u201d) may require scientific substantiation and can cross into regulated medical claims.\n\n3. Public health considerations\n   - The infant-botulism risk is well-established; jurisdictions and public-health agencies (CDC, FDA) advise against feeding honey to infants under 12 months. Signage that omits this warning could contribute to harm and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nPractical wording rules for signage (recommended)\n- Allowed (examples you can permit):\n  - \u201cHoney is naturally shelf\u2011stable and can remain good for a very long time when stored in a sealed dry container.\u201d\n  - \u201cArchaeologists have found honey preserved in sealed ancient Egyptian tombs \u2014 an example of honey\u2019s long-term stability under certain conditions.\u201d (Must be worded as illustration/history, not proof of indefinite edibility.)\n  - \u201cRaw/unpasteurized\u201d \u2014 only if it is true; require vendor to substantiate.\n  - \u201cBest before\u201d or \u201cBest if used by\u201d statements that reflect vendor or producer practice (avoid \u201cuse by\u201d if you mean quality rather than safety).\n\n- Required: \n  - Infant warning: \u201cDo not feed honey to infants under 12 months.\u201d\n  - If any health or therapeutic claims are made (e.g., wound healing, antibacterial), require the vendor to provide substantiation and, unless substantiated and permitted by regulators, disallow health-treatment claims.\n\n- Prohibited (examples you should disallow on signage):\n  - \u201cHoney never expires\u201d / \u201cHoney will last forever\u201d / \u201cHoney is immortal\u201d\n  - \u201cThis honey is always safe to eat no matter the storage\u201d (absolute safety claims)\n  - \u201cHoney kills all bacteria\u201d / \u201cHoney cures infections\u201d / \u201cHoney prevents disease\u201d (medical claims without approved substantiation)\n  - \u201cNo expiration date needed\u201d presented as a blanket recommendation for consumer safety\n  - Using the Egyptian-tomb anecdote as definitive proof (e.g., \u201cProof: honey never expires \u2014 Egyptian tomb example\u201d)\n\nSuggested short policy text for retail signage rules\n- \u201cMarketing statements must be factual and not misleading. Do not use absolute terms such as \u2018never\u2019 or \u2018always\u2019 in claims about shelf life or safety. Historical references (for example, honey recovered from ancient Egyptian tombs) may be used only as descriptive context and must not be presented as proof that all honey remains safe/edible indefinitely. All honey signage must include the infant-botulism advisory: \u2018Do not feed honey to infants under 12 months.\u2019 Any health or medical claims must be substantiated in writing before use.\u201d\n\nEnforcement and verification steps\n- Ask vendors for copies of any product claims they plan to display.\n- If they assert scientific or health benefits, request references/substantiation (studies, authoritative guidance).\n- Remove or require modification of any claim with an absolute wording or an unsubstantiated therapeutic claim.\n- Check that infant warning is displayed prominently.\n\nReferences and authorities (for your files)\n- FDA/CDC guidance on honey and infant botulism: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 infant botulism and honey advisory; FDA guidance on food labeling/misbranding.\n- FTC guidance: advertisers must have substantiation for objective claims; absolute statements are treated skeptically.\n- General scientific background: publications summarizing honey\u2019s low water activity, acidity and antimicrobial properties; archaeological reports of preserved honey in sealed tombs.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a short one-paragraph sign template (allowed version), a prohibited-phrasing list to post for vendors, and a brief vendor checklist to use during inspections.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.05, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly rejects absolute claims like \"Honey never expires,\" stating honey is highly resistant to spoilage but can spoil under certain conditions (moisture, contamination, heating).

That\u2019s why honey can remain chemically stable for very long periods.\n- Archaeological reports note jars of honey recovered from Egyptian tombs (e.g., Tutankhamun\u2019s) that were still preserved/crystallized rather than rotten. Museum reports and popular science accounts describe these finds as still \u201cgood\u201d in the sense of not putrefied.\n- Caveats: if honey is diluted with water, contaminated with yeast, stored poorly, or heated repeatedly, it can ferment, darken, or degrade.
