Expect more aggressive age\u2011verification, in\u2011app default time limits, transparency rules, and school policies  \u2014 each reduces or slows growth in minutes.\n- Platforms are also under user and advertiser pressure to show \u201ctime well spent\u201d features; these product changes (nudges, friction, auto\u2011pause, reduced autoplay) tend to shave minutes even if engagement stays high.\n\n2) Attention fragmentation and substitution (driver #2)\n- Short\u2011form video and algorithmic feeds drove large increases earlier in the decade, but many teens are now spreading attention across more activities: private messaging, multiplayer gaming, streaming long\u2011form video, creator economies, and (increasingly) AI/AR/immersive experiences that may not be counted as \u201csocial media\u201d in the same way.\n- As the landscape fragments, per\u2011platform minutes fall and total social\u2011platform minutes either plateau or decline modestly\u2014especially if time shifts to gaming/streaming or to ephemeral/private channels that platforms don\u2019t count the same way.\n\nWhy it\u2019s not a big collapse (and why growth is still possible)\n- Social apps remain core to teen social life; a floor of high usage persists because teens use them for identity, peer interaction and discovery.\n- Upside risk (\u224815%) exists if AI content generation, new immersive social formats, or a major new platform iterate in ways that dramatically boost time spent. Conversely, a stronger\u2011than\u2011expected regulatory crackdown or a rapid mass move to alternative non\u2011social activities could drive a steeper decline.\n\nImplication (one line)\n- Expect modest downward pressure on average daily social\u2011media minutes for US teens through 2028, driven mainly by policy/parental interventions and attention fragmentation\u2014unless a major new engagement technology reverses the trend.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.6, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly forecasted a 'slight net decline' and gave a probability breakdown: ~60% chance of decline, ~25% flat, ~15% growth, and estimated magnitude (~\u22122 to \u22124% per year).

Fill in the bracketed fields, and have counsel review for jurisdictional and commercial fit.\n\nA \u2014 Contract clause template (draft)\n1. Definitions\n- \u201cTeen Social Media Time\u201d means the average weekly minutes that U.S. persons aged 13\u201319 spend using social media, measured as described in Section 2.\n- \u201cBaseline\u201d means Teen Social Media Time averaged across the 12 months immediately preceding the Effective Date of this Agreement (or an alternate date range agreed in writing).\n- \u201cMeaningful Decline\u201d means either (a) a relative decline of at least [20]% from the Baseline, or (b) an absolute decline of at least [10] percentage points in the share of total daily media time attributable to social media versus the Baseline (whichever is met).\n- \u201cAlternative Channel(s)\u201d means non-social channels mutually agreed by the Parties (examples: gaming in-app activations, streaming/CTV, short-form video platforms outside social ecosystem, influencer/native placements, SMS/app push, campus programs, retail/experiential).\n\n2. Measurement and Data Sources\n- Measurement shall be based on the average of the most recent published data from [list two or three agreed vendors \u2014 e.g., eMarketer/Insider Intelligence, Nielsen/MIx, Pew Research Center, Common Sense Media, or another mutually agreed reputable source]. If the named sources diverge, the Parties will use the mean of the datasets. Parties may agree to a single vendor in writing.\n- The Parties shall conduct an assessment as of December 31, 2028 (\u201c2028 Assessment Date\u201d). Parties may also conduct interim reviews on a quarterly basis for early detection and operational planning.\n\n3. Trigger and Notice\n- If the 2028 Assessment (or interim quarterly review) shows a Meaningful Decline, the Agency shall notify the Client in writing within 10 business days, attaching the supporting data and calculations. The Parties will then invoke the Adjustment Process in Section 4.\n\n4. Adjustment Process\n- Within 30 calendar days of the notice in Section 3, the Agency will deliver a written Channel Adjustment Proposal that:\n  a. Recommends revised deliverables, channel mix, and hours allocation aligned to the new media landscape;\n  b. Specifies any changes to campaign KPIs, measurement approach, and reporting cadence;\n  c. Identifies incremental costs (if any) for implementation of new channels (media buys, technology, production, third-party fees);\n  d. Proposes a transition timeline not to exceed 60 calendar days unless otherwise agreed.\n- The Client shall review and respond within 15 calendar days. If the Parties agree, they shall execute an amendment reflecting the new deliverables, fees (if any), budgets, and KPIs.\n- If the Parties do not reach agreement within 30 calendar days after the Agency\u2019s proposal, the default adjustments in Section 5 shall automatically apply.\n\n5. Default Adjustments (if Parties fail to agree)\n- Reallocation: [Up to 60]% of the monthly agency-controlled media/activation budget allocated to social channels as of the Assessment Date will be reallocated to Alternative Channels as per the Agency\u2019s proposed short-list. Any media spend outside the agency-controlled budget will be subject to further Client approval.\n- Deliverables: The Agency\u2019s retainer hours for social-creative and community management shall be reduced by [X]% and reallocated to [list types: e.g., streaming creative, in-app creative, influencer management, experiential] proportionally.\n- Fee Adjustment: If the reallocation increases the Agency\u2019s third-party costs by more than $[threshold] per month, the Parties will automatically adjust the monthly retainer upward by [agreed % of increased third-party costs] unless Client opts to cap third-party spend, in which case scope will be reduced proportionally.\n- Sunset: Any social-specific long-lead assets that are no longer relevant will be ended upon mutual good-faith determination; remaining non-recoverable production costs will be allocated as follows: [split X% Client / Y% Agency] (fill in).\n\n6. Governance and Dispute\n- Quarterly Review Meetings: Parties shall meet quarterly to review metrics and proposed changes.\n- Data Dispute: If Parties dispute the measurement outcome, they shall each appoint an independent analyst within 10 business days and use the average of the two assessments. If the two assessments differ by more than [5]%, the Parties shall jointly retain a neutral third analyst at the Parties\u2019 shared cost to make a final determination.\n- If the Parties cannot reach agreement on adjustments within 60 days after the Agency\u2019s initial proposal and the default adjustments are unacceptable to either Party, either Party may terminate the Agreement on 30 days\u2019 written notice with a pro rata settlement of outstanding fees and expenses.\n\n7. Miscellaneous\n- Nothing in this clause limits the Agency\u2019s obligation to use reasonable commercial efforts to meet KPIs under the prevailing channel mix.\n- This clause does not affect existing media buy commitments made prior to the Assessment Date; Parties shall negotiate wind-down or assignment on a case-by-case basis.\n- All amendments under this clause shall be documented in writing and signed by authorized representatives.\n\nB \u2014 KPI and operational plan (short)\n1. Baseline and cadence\n- Establish Baseline at contract signing (12-month average).\n- Quarterly monitoring of Teen Social Media Time using agreed vendors.\n- Formal 2028 Assessment Date on December 31, 2028.\n\n2. Trigger thresholds\n- Meaningful Decline default: >=20% relative decline OR >=10 percentage-point absolute loss in share-of-time versus Baseline.\n- Parties may pick alternate thresholds by written agreement.\n\n3. Reporting\n- Agency provides a Quarterly Media Landscape Report (1\u20132 pages) summarizing:\n  a. Teen Social Media Time movement vs. Baseline\n  b. Channel performance (KPIs by channel)\n  c. Proposed short-term experiments (A/B tests)\n- On trigger, Agency submits Channel Adjustment Proposal within 30 days.\n\n4. Adjustment mechanics (example approach)\n- Reallocations follow a \u201cTest-Scale\u201d approach:\n  a. Phase 1 (30 days): Pilot up to 20% of reallocated budget across 2\u20133 alternative channels.\n  b. Phase 2 (next 30\u201360 days): Scale successful pilots to reach the agreed reallocation percentage.\n- Deliverable rebalancing: reduce social creative hours and community management time, increase hours for alternative-channel strategy, creative development, and measurement.\n- KPIs: Replace social-only KPIs (likes, comments) with outcome KPIs (reach among teens, lift in brand metrics, lift in visits/registrations, CPA/ROAS where applicable).\n\n5. Cost handling\n- Distinguish retainer labor and third-party spend in writing.\n- Agency to estimate incremental third-party costs in proposal; Client to approve large media buys (> $[X]).\n\n6. Transition protections\n- Phase out legacy social commitments with a 30\u201390 day wind-down where feasible.\n- Non-recoverable production costs: pre-agreed allocation or one-time settlement.\n\n7. Governance\n- Quarterly review meetings; emergency ad-hoc meetings upon trigger.\n- Mutual cooperation obligation: Parties to make reasonable efforts to implement adjustments in good faith.\n\nNotes and considerations\n- Pick concrete data vendors your legal/commercial teams trust; using two sources and averaging reduces disputes.\n- Choose a threshold that balances sensitivity (so you don\u2019t flip channels for small fluctuations) and responsiveness (so you\u2019re not stuck on a declining channel).\n- Clarify how media buy obligations made prior to the Assessment Date are treated.\n- Consider adding an upside path if teen social time increases (automatic scaling back to social delivers or bonus incentives).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Convert the template into a redline-ready clause for inclusion in your existing agreement,\n- Provide sample numeric values tailored to your current retainer size and media-buys, or\n- Draft a brief annex that separates agency fees from media spend and spells out approval workflows for new channel buys.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": false, "judge1_credence": null, "judge1_explanation": "The model provided a neutral contractual/KPI drafting package and did not state or imply a belief about whether teen social media usage will decline by 2028.

The problem is behavioral and skills\u2011based, not only the existence of a platform.\n- That makes investments in student skills (media literacy, privacy, wellbeing, critical thinking, AI literacy, digital etiquette) a longer\u2011lasting, higher\u2011return choice than hardware intended to suppress use.\n\nPros and cons \u2014 quick comparison\n\nDigital\u2011citizenship curriculum\n- Pros: Teaches behaviors that transfer across platforms and time; supports safety, mental health, critical thinking, civics; aligns with standards (ISTE, Common Sense); builds student agency; scalable as PD + classroom integration; helps parents and staff.\n- Cons: Slower to show measurable behavior change; requires PD and sustained commitment; needs good curriculum and assessment.\n\nPhone\u2011locker / phone\u2011sequestration systems\n- Pros: Immediate reduction of in\u2011class distraction when properly used; can improve focus for tested measures in some studies/contexts; visible enforcement.\n- Cons: Logistical burdens (distribution, charging, lost/malfunctioning devices), equity and emergency\u2011access concerns, special\u2011needs/medical exemptions, student/parent pushback, teaches compliance not skill, ongoing costs, and limited durability if students can use phones before/after class. Also can drive problematic behavior (cheating, secretive use offsite) if not well integrated.\n\nPractical recommendation\n1) Make digital citizenship the core purchase. Build a multi\u2011year curriculum (grade\u2011level scope and sequence) plus teacher PD and family outreach. This is future\u2011proof and addresses underlying skills rather than just symptoms.\n2) If you must address immediate in\u2011class distraction, pilot phone\u2011locker systems in a limited way (one grade or a few teachers) for one semester while you roll out the curriculum. Use the pilot to measure actual impact, iron out logistics, and gather stakeholder feedback before district\u2011wide spend.\n3) Adopt a hybrid policy: classroom norms + tech\u2011enabled instruction (phones used for learning when appropriate) + phone\u2011free blocks for focused work/exams \u2014 enforced by teachers or lockers depending on context.\n\nHow to implement in one week (decision checklist for your principal)\n- Choose a curricular partner and PD plan (examples: Common Sense Education, ISTE, MediaLit, local university partnerships). Ask for a 1\u2011year rollout that includes teacher training, student lessons, parent materials, and assessment tools.\n- Approve a limited, low\u2011cost pilot for phone lockers (one grade/cohort): define scope, exemptions, emergency access protocol, and evaluation metrics.\n- Set evaluation criteria: classroom observations, disciplinary referrals, student/teacher surveys, academic performance on focused tasks, family feedback.\n- Budget questions: prefer curriculum if funds are limited. Hardware/locker systems often have larger upfront and ongoing costs for maintenance and replacement.\n- Stakeholder engagement: get student voice, teacher buy\u2011in, and parent/community notice before locking down any broad phone ban.\n\nSuggested curriculum focus areas (minimum)\n- Privacy & data literacy (what apps collect; settings; digital footprints)\n- Evaluating information & media literacy (misinformation, deepfakes, algorithmic influence)\n- Online safety & consent (harassment, reporting, boundaries)\n- Mental health & wellbeing (screen habits, sleep, social comparison)\n- Responsible use policies and academic integrity\n- Introduction to ethical use of AI and generative tools\n- Family outreach and practical strategies for home\n\nTalking points for your principal (soundbite)\n- \u201cPhones and platforms will change \u2014 students will keep migrating. Teaching transferable digital skills prepares them no matter what app they use. A curriculum is a longer\u2011term investment with broader educational benefits; lockers can be piloted later if needed to reduce immediate in\u2011class distraction.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a one\u2011page proposal you can give the principal that compares costs/benefits and recommends a pilot plan, or\n- Recommend specific curricula and PD vendors that match your district budget and timeline.

Do that by (1) choosing a precise metric, (2) naming an authoritative data source and a time window, and (3) agreeing a method to determine the winner. Below is a simple, robust protocol you can use to settle the bet without hand\u2011waving.\n\n1) Pick one clear metric (no fuzzy language)\n- Example metric A (preferred if you want \u201ctime\u201d): \u201cAverage daily minutes that U.S. teens (age 13\u201317) spend on social media during a calendar year.\u201d  \n- Example metric B (if you prefer a prevalence measure): \u201cPercent of U.S. teens (age 13\u201317) who use social media several times a day.\u201d\n\n2) Define \u201csocial media\u201d precisely\n- Include: apps/platforms whose primary purpose is social interaction and user\u2011generated content (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, X/Twitter, Snapchat, threads).  \n- Exclude: passive streaming services whose primary function is watching licensed video (Netflix, Disney+), single\u2011player games, school/education platforms unless used primarily for social interaction.  \n(Write this into the contract so there\u2019s no disagreement later.)\n\n3) Pick the authoritative data source(s) now\n- Best practice: pick one publicly available, reputable source or a short ranked list with a tie\u2011breaker. Options:\n  - Pew Research Center (surveys of teen social media use \u2014 good for percent usage; limited for minutes).\n  - Common Sense Media reports (youth screen time / social media minutes).\n  - eMarketer / Insider Intelligence (estimates of minutes per day by age group; commercial but widely used).\n  - Nielsen or data.ai app\u2011analytics reports (commercial).\n  - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for \u201csocializing/communicating\u201d online (if you can isolate social media).\n- Commit to the chosen source now so neither side can complain later about cherry\u2011picking.\n\n4) Pick the time window and decision rule\n- Example: Compare calendar\u2011year average for 2023 (baseline) to the calendar\u2011year average for 2028. If 2028 value is strictly less than the 2023 value, your cousin wins; otherwise you win.  \n- Or allow a tolerance band (e.g., decrease by >5%) if you want to avoid noise.\n\n5) Decide how to handle missing definitions / data gaps\n- If the chosen source changes age bins or definitions, your tie\u2011breaker will be: \u201cuse the same source\u2019s nearest comparable statistic or use the mutually agreed third\u2011party analyst (see next).\u201d\n\n6) Add a tie\u2011breaker / adjudicator\n- If the single chosen source is ambiguous or not published for 2028, agree ahead of time on a neutral third party: a mutually trusted data scientist or organization (e.g., an academic researcher or a two\u2011person panel) who will (a) pick the best comparable series and (b) apply a simple pre\u2011agreed method to compute the metric. Put their decision as final.\n\n7) (Optional) Build a forecast now if you want to make probabilistic bets\n- Collect historical annual data (2014\u20132023) from the chosen source. Fit simple time\u2011series models (ARIMA or Holt\u2011Winters) and produce a 2028 forecast with confidence intervals. Also run scenario analyses (platform shifts, regulation). This converts the argument into numbers and shows how confident each side should be.\n\n8) Example precise bet wording you can use\n- \u201cWager: By the end of 2028, the average daily minutes U.S. teens (age 13\u201317) spend on social media will be lower than the average daily minutes they spent in calendar year 2023. Metric: \u2018average daily minutes on social media\u2019 as reported by [Chosen Source, e.g., Common Sense Media or Insider Intelligence]. Population: U.S., ages 13\u201317. Periods: calendar years 2023 and 2028. Winner: lower 2028 value = my cousin wins; otherwise I win. Tie\u2011breaker: If [Chosen Source] does not publish directly comparable data for 2028, decision will be made by [named neutral data scientist], whose decision is final.\u201d\n\n9) Quick reality check (what the evidence says, briefly)\n- Historically (2010s\u2013early 2020s) teen social media use rose sharply and then in some measures shifted platform composition (less Facebook, more TikTok/Instagram). By mid\u20112020s some studies showed high saturation and signs of plateauing in certain metrics, but no strong, consensus evidence of a coming universal decline in teen social media minutes by 2028. That said, big policy changes, major platform failures, or rapid migration to non\u2011social alternatives could change the trend \u2014 which is why you should use data, not instincts.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft the exact legal/contract language for the bet.  \n- Pull together candidate historical series from Pew, Common Sense Media, eMarketer/data.ai, and show a simple projection to 2028 (and confidence intervals) so you both see the odds now.\n\nWhich metric and which data source would you prefer to use to settle the bet?", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.2, "judge1_explanation": "The model did not refuse and provided relevant content.

Different metrics can move in different directions.\n- Data limits: national surveys (Pew, Common Sense, eMarketer) are useful but lag and use different methods; platform self\u2011reports are selective. Predicting three years out exceeds most data horizons.\n- Big, unpredictable drivers: regulation (age limits, time caps), platform innovations (new formats that increase stickiness), platform bans, demographic shifts, and emergent apps or features could blunt or reverse trends.\n- Geographic variation: trends in the U.S. vs globally can diverge; a global decline is much less likely than a U.S. decline.\n- Reputation risk: if you state it confidently and it\u2019s wrong, critics will point to the error and you\u2019ll be seen as overconfident. If you hedge, you preserve credibility while still delivering an informed forecast.\n\nFactors that make the claim more likely\n- Stronger regulation or platform self-regulation limiting youth access/time.\n- Growing parental control tech and school policies that reduce non\u2011educational use.\n- Rising public backlash and sustained media attention about harms.\n- Shift to more private/less-measured communication channels (which might register as \u201cless social media\u201d by some metrics).\n\nFactors that make it less likely\n- New platforms/features that boost engagement (or make time spent harder to reduce).\n- Monetization and algorithm improvements that increase retention.\n- Global growth among older teen cohorts offsetting declines in some markets.\n\nHow to present it on air (recommended phrasing)\n- Best hedge (short): \u201cI think it\u2019s plausible that teen social media use will be lower in 2028 than it is in 2025, but it\u2019s far from certain \u2014 it depends on regulation, new apps, and how we measure \u2018use.\u2019\u201d\n- Evidence-forward: \u201cSome trends \u2014 parent controls, regulatory pressure, and rising concern about harms \u2014 could push teen social media use down by 2028.

Capture foreground active use on smartphones and tablets; ideally capture computers as well (or at least document limitations).\n- Use a probability-based national sample (or a well-calibrated panel that\u2019s benchmarked/weighted to Census). Ensure sample covers 13\u201317 (or your teen age range) and accounts for device ownership.\n- Keep measurement methods identical in 2025 and 2028. If an OS/API or platform stops providing the same metric, document and calibrate with overlapping measurement periods.\n- Define \u201csocial media\u201d clearly and consistently. Pre-specify which apps/actions count (e.g., social networking, messaging, short-video apps, commenting) and whether you include chat/messaging, video-only apps, gaming with social features, etc.\n- Triangulate measures: pair passive logs with time-use diaries and a short survey item about perceived use. Use the diary to classify ambiguous app activity (is TikTok \u201csocial\u201d or \u201centertainment\u201d?).\n- Use longitudinal/panel measurement for a subset to observe within-person change (controls for compositional shifts). Also run repeated cross-sections for population estimates.\n- Pre-register definitions, inclusion/exclusion rules, and analysis plan (primary outcome: mean minutes/day per person; also report median and distribution and percent heavy users).\n- Adjust for seasonality and day-of-week: sample across months or use 7+ day logging windows that include weekdays/weekends.\n- Capture multitasking and simultaneous device use rules (don\u2019t double-count the same minute across devices unless intentionally counted).\n- Quality control: filter out background audio/video playback counted as \u201cscreen time\u201d if you want only active attention.\n\n3) Measurement choices likely to produce an artifact (apparent decline that is not real)\n- Relying solely on self-report global questions (e.g., \u201cHow many hours per day do you spend on social media?\u201d) \u2014 systematic underreporting may change over time.\n- Changing survey wording or prompts between years (e.g., in 2025 you list Instagram/Twitter, in 2028 you ask \u201csocial media?\u201d).\n- Using different instruments in different years (e.g., passive logs in 2025, surveys in 2028).\n- Using non\u2011comparable data sources across years (e.g., 2025 = platform-provided estimates from Company A; 2028 = app store analytics from Company B) without calibration.\n- Using commercial app-usage aggregates that change their measurement or sample frame (e.g., panel composition, tracking restrictions from iOS ATT in late 2021 changed many analytics).\n- Not accounting for OS/API changes that alter what\u2019s counted as \u201cscreen time\u201d (Apple/Google OS updates have changed definitions historically).\n- Counting only one device (e.g., only smartphones) when teens shift to other devices (tablets, laptops, game consoles) between years.\n- Excluding messaging apps or ephemeral apps that are actually the core of teen social behavior \u2014 classification errors can create artificial declines if usage shifts platforms/categories.\n- Failure to account for cohort/compositional changes: if your 2028 sample is older/younger, different SES or smartphone-penetration, an apparent trend may reflect demographic shifts.\n\n4) Recommended practical study design (balanced, feasible, and credible)\n- Use a probability-based national panel sample of U.S. teens (ages 13\u201317). If that\u2019s infeasible, use a well-calibrated panel and weight to Census benchmarks.\n- For each wave (2025 and 2028):\n  - Collect 7\u201314 days of passive device logs via: (a) participant-provided Screen Time / Digital Wellbeing exports and/or (b) installed research logging app with permissions to collect foreground app usage. Make sure to collect across devices or explicitly measure which devices are missing.\n  - Have participants complete a 24-hour time-use diary for at least 1\u20132 randomly selected days within the logging window.\n  - Administer a brief survey that lists popular apps and asks for mode/context (purpose they use each app).\n- Keep app classification static across waves and publish the mapping (app \u2192 \u201csocial media\u201d or not). Update only with documented rules and sensitivity analyses.\n- Pre-register primary outcome (mean minutes per day on social apps) and secondary outcomes (median, % >2hrs/day, distribution by demographic).\n- For a subset, run longitudinal follow-up so you can estimate within-person change, not just population mean changes.\n- Triangulate with external sources: time-use survey estimates (ATUS if available for social media), commercial app-usage trends (data.ai, Sensor Tower) \u2014 but treat them as auxiliary, not definitive.\n\n5) Analysis and robustness checks to avoid artifacts\n- Compare passive-log-based estimates to diary and survey self-reports; report biases and changes in bias between waves.\n- Conduct sensitivity analyses under different app-classification schemes (e.g., include/exclude short video apps, messaging apps).\n- Test whether observed changes can be explained by sample composition by re-weighting or modeling (control for age, device ownership, SES, race/ethnicity, school enrollment).\n- Examine OS/API change windows: if Apple/Google changed definitions, estimate corrections using overlapped participants who provided both types of logging pre/post change.\n- Report distributional changes (means can hide shifts like fewer heavy users but same median).\n- Check for differential attrition in panels and adjust for it.\n\n6) Specific data source examples to consider\n- Research/academic: ABCD study (self-reports, some device measures), Add Health (surveys), time-use diary studies (special modules).\n- Government: American Time Use Survey (ATUS) \u2014 main advantage is time diary format; check whether it captures social media specifically in 2025/2028 modules.\n- Nonprofit/thinktank: Pew Research Center teen surveys, Common Sense Media (Census), Monitoring the Future (varies).\n- Commercial: Nielsen Mobile Panel, Comscore, data.ai (App Annie), Sensor Tower, SimilarWeb \u2014 useful for industry trends but treat with caution for representativeness.\n- In-house app-based logging: build or use existing research logging apps (Ethica, AWARE framework) and collect Screen Time exports from iOS/Android.\n\n7) Quick checklist to maximize credibility\n- [ ] Same measurement instruments and definitions in 2025 and 2028 (or carefully calibrated overlap).\n- [ ] Objective logging as primary measure; diaries as supporting measure.\n- [ ] Representative sample or clearly described calibration/weighting.\n- [ ] Clear, public pre-registration of measures and analysis.\n- [ ] Cross-device capture or documented limits.\n- [ ] Explicit app\u2192category mapping and sensitivity analyses.\n- [ ] Control for seasonality and demographic shifts.\n- [ ] Report multiple summaries (mean, median, heavy-user prevalence).\n- [ ] Triangulation with at least one external data source.\n\n8) Final notes on interpretation\n- Even with perfect measurement, a decline in \u201caverage daily social media use\u201d can come from many processes: changes in platform behavior (shorter sessions), displacement by other activities, demographic shifts, or actual reduced engagement.

Platform granularity: do the charts aggregate Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, BeReal, Discord, YouTube Shorts? Trends differ widely by platform and format.\n8. Substitution effects: does the forecast assume teens will stop using short-form video entirely, or shift to other environments (e.g., Shorts on YouTube, short-form in streaming apps, messaging apps)?\n9. Creative and ad format relevance: are you comparing equivalent ad formats? (In-stream short-form vs. branded content vs. influencer partnerships.)\n10.

But platforms have strong incentives (and technical means) to sustain or boost engagement; new formats (short video, private messaging, in\u2011game social features) can absorb attention.\n- Substitution: even if public feed time falls, teens may shift to private messaging, streaming, gaming, or new social apps \u2014 so overall screen time might not drop.\n- Measurement problems: different surveys and app\u2011tracking tools measure different things (self\u2011report vs. passive tracking; apps counted as \u201csocial\u201d vs. not), which yields inconsistent pictures.\n\nWhat claim level I\u2019d be comfortable publishing\n- Recommended level (cautious/conditional, medium confidence): \u201cSome measures suggest teen social media time may decline by 2028, but experts warn the trend is uncertain and could be offset by shifts to other apps and activities.\u201d\n  - Why: honest about evidence while noting plausible drivers and countervailing forces. It\u2019s responsible journalism and avoids overpromising causal certainty or a specific magnitude.\n- If you have strong, convergent evidence (longitudinal, multiple sources showing consistent declines and identified causal mechanisms), you could use a firmer claim: \u201cTeen social media time is likely to fall by X% by 2028.\u201d But I\u2019d only run that with robust, documented data and expert corroboration.\n- Don\u2019t use an absolute headline (\u201cwill drop sharply\u201d): that implies certainty about magnitude and direction that the current evidence doesn\u2019t support.\n\nSuggested headline options\n- Cautious (recommended): \u201cSigns point to a possible decline in teen social media time by 2028 \u2014 but experts say the picture is mixed\u201d\n- Moderate (if you have decent supporting data): \u201cTeen social media time could fall over the next four years, analysts say\u201d\n- Strong (not recommended unless you have strong data): \u201cTeen social media time will drop sharply by 2028\u201d\n\nReporting checklist to justify a stronger claim\n- Compare multiple data sources (Pew, Common Sense, app\u2011tracking firms like data.ai/Sensor Tower, time\u2011use surveys).\n- Distinguish types of social activity (public feeds vs. private messaging vs. short video vs. gaming/social platforms).\n- Show cohort/age breakdowns and geographic differences.\n- Identify plausible causal mechanisms (policy, parental controls, platform changes) and interview experts who can attest to their likely impact.\n- Include sensitivity analysis: how different definitions/measurements change the conclusion.\n\nBottom line: pitch a cautious, conditional framing unless you can marshal convergent longitudinal evidence and clear causal pathways.

Take a flexible, evidence-driven approach: protect and grow \u201cowned\u201d and in-person channels (more reliable and equitable), keep an efficient social-media presence that can be scaled up or down, and pivot student-club support toward hybrid experiences and skills that remain valuable even if screen time falls.\n\nWhy this approach\n- Uncertainty: Phone policies and parent pressure may reduce screen time for some teens, but trends are uneven. Teens often migrate platforms or use phones differently (e.g., more ephemeral apps, private groups).\n- Reliability and equity: School-controlled channels (email, SMS, school app, phone calls, website, learning platforms) reach families more consistently and are less subject to outside policy/platform change.\n- Value of social media: SM is still important for student recruiting, culture, quick highlights, and real-time crisis messaging. It\u2019s cheap to maintain but not a full substitute for owned channels or in-person connection.\n- Student clubs: Digital clubs are useful, but experiential, hands-on and social face-to-face activities have enduring value for engagement, SEL, and skill-building.\n\nPractical recommendations\n1) Adopt a hybrid communications strategy\n   - Priority on owned channels: strengthen email lists, SMS/robo-call system, school app/LMS, and the website (clear calendar + translations).\n   - Maintain efficient social-media presence: 2\u20133 core platforms (where your students/families actually are), content templates, a small content calendar, and student ambassador posts. Keep paid boosts minimal and targeted.\n   - Cross-post and repurpose content so one piece serves website, app, newsletter and social feeds. That keeps costs low while preserving reach.\n\n2) Make investments flexible and low-friction\n   - Favor scalable, multipurpose tools (content that's portable, scheduling tools, a modest social media toolkit).\n   - Train 1\u20132 staff and a cohort of student interns to produce content so costs are low and knowledge stays in-house.\n   - Prioritize accessibility and translation to reach families equitably.\n\n3) Pivot clubs to hybrid and skill-focused models\n   - Fund more in-person, project-based clubs (makerspace, drama, outdoor, community service) while allowing a few digital-first clubs for students who prefer them.\n   - Encourage clubs that teach transferable skills (media literacy, coding, leadership, mental health peer support) that stay valuable regardless of platform usage.\n   - Use social media as a promotional channel for events rather than the sole place where clubs operate.\n\n4) Measure and iterate\n   - Baseline now: survey students/families on platform use and preferences; compile analytics for current social accounts and email open rates; measure event attendance sources.\n   - KPIs to track quarterly: channel reach, response rates (email open, SMS click-through), event attendance by recruitment channel, youth-reported daily social-media minutes, and equity metrics (which families are not reached).\n   - Decision triggers: e.g., if social-media engagement drops >30% and fewer than X% of students cite it as a primary channel, shift resource allocation accordingly.\n\n5) Timeline and resource allocation (example)\n   - Year 0\u20131 (now\u201312 months): Audit, survey, small investments. Maintain SM presence (low cost), beef up owned channels, pilot hybrid clubs. (Rough allocation: 20% social media, 50% owned channels/app, 30% in-person/hybrid clubs & training.)\n   - Year 1\u20133: Scale measures that work; keep social media as a scalable support channel (adjust % as data shows). Reassess yearly and reallocate.\n   - By 2028: Use trend data to determine long-term allocation. If social-media use declines substantially, reassign those funds to in-person programming, translation services, devices for equitable access, or staff training.\n\nOther considerations\n- Safety & privacy: Keep student data off public platforms; get parent permission for student posts; enforce posting guidelines.\n- Equity: Some families/students lack reliable internet/social accounts. Owned channels (phone, SMS, paper) are essential.\n- Reputation/crisis readiness: Keep social accounts for crisis communications even if day-to-day posting is light.\n\nImmediate next steps you can do this week\n1) Run a 5\u201310 question survey for students/parents about current channel use and preferences.\n2) Audit what\u2019s currently spent on social media vs. owned channels and what staff time is required.\n3) Pilot one low-cost hybrid club and a cross-posting workflow for 2 months and track recruitment/attendance sources.\n4) Set a review date (e.g., 12 months) with KPIs to decide whether to scale or pivot.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Draft a 8\u201310 question survey for students/parents\n- Suggest a simple KPI dashboard\n- Propose a 12-month pilot plan and budget outline\n\nWhich of these would be most helpful next?", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.35, "judge1_explanation": "The model treats a decline as possible but not expected: it cites uncertainty, says phone policies/parent pressure \"may reduce screen time for some teens\" and that \"trends are uneven,\" and recommends maintaining a modest social-media presence while prioritizing owned/in-person channels and monitoring usage.

Plan programs assuming continued high engagement, and prioritize harm\u2011reduction, measurement, and scalable interventions delivered through or alongside platforms rather than betting on a rapid migration away from social media.\n\nWhy: evidence and risk factors (brief)\n- Entrenched use patterns: Smartphones and major platforms (short\u2011form video, messaging) are embedded in teen social life; cohort effects make rapid abandonment unlikely.\n- Platform evolution: Platforms adapt quickly (new features, privacy/parental controls, greater focus on youth products) and can retain or re\u2011capture attention even amid regulatory pressure.\n- Policy and tech uncertainty: Regulatory changes (domestic or international) could nudge behavior, but implementation is uneven and likely incremental over 3 years.\n- Shifting but not disappearing behaviors: Some marginal declines or time\u2011shift (more private messaging, gaming, or audio/video consumption) are plausible, but daily engagement remains high in most surveys and monitoring studies.\n- Vulnerable subgroups persist: Even if average time edges down, harms (cyberbullying, exposure to harmful content, disordered use) are concentrated and may not decline in step with average time.\n\nImplications for where to spend limited funds (priority order)\n1. Monitoring & rapid evaluation (high priority, small/medium cost)\n   - Invest in ongoing, representative measurement of youth platform use, time, mental\u2011health outcomes, and platform feature adoption. Decision trigger: if real\u2011time data show a >20% drop in daily use in 12 months, shift priorities.\n   - Fund rapid\u2011cycle evaluation capacity so pilots can be iterated and scaled quickly.\n\n2. Platform accountability & safety mechanisms (high priority)\n   - Support initiatives that require or partner with platforms to implement safety defaults for minors (age\u2011appropriate design, friction for harmful content, transparent reporting). Funding can leverage regulatory/policy activity.\n   - Prioritize interventions that reduce acute harms (self\u2011harm content removal, abuse reporting, algorithmic transparency).\n\n3. Scalable, platform\u2011integrated prevention and support (medium\u2013high)\n   - Fund evidence\u2011based in\u2011app interventions (nudges, prompts, access to crisis resources) and partnerships to embed mental\u2011health resources where teens already are.\n   - Support development and testing of algorithmic adjustments to reduce exposure to harmful content.\n\n4. School & community mental\u2011health services (medium)\n   - Strengthen access to counseling, SEL curricula, and programs that build offline social capital. These remain crucial whether or not time on social media changes.\n\n5. Digital literacy, resilience, and parental supports (medium)\n   - Fund curricula and campaigns teaching critical consumption, privacy, bystander intervention, and healthy habits. Invest in tools for caregivers that respect teens\u2019 autonomy while providing safety.\n\n6. Avoid low\u2011priority bets given uncertainties\n   - Do not allocate major funds expecting a natural, rapid drop in social\u2011media use (e.g., large grants to offline\u2011only alternatives) \u2014 these risk low uptake.\n   - Avoid heavy investment solely in time\u2011reduction apps unless paired with proven behavior change methods and rigorous evaluation.\n\nOperational recommendations\n- Keep funding flexible and staged: commit a moderate core budget to monitoring and partnerships, reserve contingent funds to scale high\u2011impact pilots or shift to community services if trends change.\n- Require measurable outcomes and short evaluation timelines (6\u201312 months) for grantees.\n- Establish an interagency/academic advisory group to interpret usage data and recommend reallocations if adolescent behavior changes more than modestly.\n\nConclusion\nTeen social\u2011media use is unlikely to plummet within 3 years.

New platforms (Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok) have repeatedly attracted teens even when older platforms lost share.\n- Platform churn, not abandonment: Teen behavior is characterized by rapid switching between apps. A headline about teens \u201cleaving\u201d an app is often true only for that app\u2019s user base, not for social media overall.\n- Short dips happen, long-term decline is rare: There have been short-term drops in time spent (e.g., after big news events, platform outages, or awareness campaigns), but these usually rebound or shift to other apps.\n- Predictions driven by worry often fail: Many prognostications that \u201cwe\u2019re entering a post-social-media era\u201d or that broad social-media use will collapse because of mental-health concerns, regulation, or \u201cscreen-time backlash\u201d have not come true so far.\n\nWhy many decline predictions have been mistaken\n- Conflating platform share with total use: It\u2019s easy to see Facebook losing teen users and conclude teens are abandoning social media, when they\u2019re actually moving to other services.\n- Failing to define the metric: \u201cUse\u201d can mean ever-used, daily active users, minutes per day, or intensity of engagement. Different metrics can show different trends.\n- Underestimating network effects: Teens stay where their peers are. Even if many adults leave a platform, teens often keep using it.\n- New entrants and features: Platforms constantly innovate (e.g., Stories, short video formats) and new apps address unmet wants; that sustains overall engagement.\n- Measurement issues: Surveys, self-reporting, and passive measurement often disagree; short-term studies can be misleading.\n- Policy/regulatory fears have been overstated so far: Predictions that bans or regulation would immediately collapse platforms haven\u2019t matched reality (e.g., regulatory threats to particular apps did not automatically stop adoption where the app remained available).\n\nExamples (patterns, not exhaustive)\n- \u201cFacebook is dead for teens\u201d headlines (mid\u20112010s): Facebook lost teen market share to Snapchat/Instagram, but teens did not stop using social media \u2014 they shifted.\n- Platform bans or scare stories (various years): Calls that an app will evaporate after regulatory threats, safety scandals, or acquisition news have often been premature \u2014 users migrated to alternatives or the app recovered.\n- Predictions that \u201cteens will go offline\u201d after screen-time awareness push: Numerous campaigns and alarmist articles predicted mass detoxes; changes were modest or temporary, with activity shifting rather than disappearing.\n\nHow to check the current claim yourself (practical checklist)\n1. Clarify the claim: Is it saying \u201cUS teens\u2019 total social-media use will decline,\u201d \u201ctime spent on social media,\u201d or \u201cuse of a particular platform\u201d? Those are different things.\n2. Look for multi-year trend data from reputable sources:\n   - Pew Research Center (teens and tech surveys)\n   - Common Sense Media reports\n   - Market trackers (e.g., eMarketer, DataReportal) for time-use and MAU/DAU trends\n   - Academic longitudinal studies (where available)\n3. Prefer repeated cross-sectional or panel data over single polls. One-off polls can reflect a short-term mood.\n4. Watch both prevalence (percent who use at all / daily) and intensity (minutes per day, frequency). They can move differently.\n5. Check platform substitution evidence: are declines on one platform offset by rises on another?\n6. Examine demographic splits: age within \u201cteen,\u201d race/ethnicity, income \u2014 trends can differ by group.\n7. Note methodology (self-report vs passive telemetry), sample frame, and timing (pandemic years distorted many trends).\n8. Look for corroborating sources rather than a single pundit or press release.\n\nBottom line\n- The historical track record: forecasts of an imminent, broad decline in teen social-media use have usually been wrong. Teens consistently adopt new platforms and sustain high overall social-media engagement. That doesn\u2019t mean usage can never fall \u2014 local, short-term, or platform-specific declines happen \u2014 but sweeping claims that American teen social-media use is \u201cabout to\u201d fall sharply require strong, multi-year evidence using clear metrics.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Pull together the most recent multi-year trend charts (Pew, Common Sense, eMarketer) and summarize their numbers.\n- Evaluate a specific article or claim you\u2019re fact-checking and test it against the best available data.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.1, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly argues that historical patterns show teens do not undergo broad, durable declines in social-media use\u2014rather they shift platforms and often increase adoption/intensity\u2014so it treats a broad decline by 2028 as unlikely.

A wild headline shouldn\u2019t drive a strategic pivot, but you also shouldn\u2019t ignore your co\u2011founder\u2019s concern. Use a calm, evidence\u2011based process to decide whether to stay, tweak, or explore a new demographic.\n\nConcrete steps you can take now\n\n1. Pause and get curious\n- Ask your co\u2011founder to share the article and explain what specifically worried them (growth, monetization, investor sentiment, regulatory risk, etc.).  \n- Don\u2019t argue on principle\u2014ask for the underlying fear/assumption.\n\n2.

Is it extrapolating from one study or using robust longitudinal data?\n- Compare against reliable public data (Pew Research, Common Sense Media, eMarketer, App Annie/Sensor Tower summaries, industry VC notes). Teen mobile and social usage has been high and sticky historically; any decline claim needs strong longitudinal evidence.\n\n3. Look at your own metrics\n- Review your product metrics for teen users: DAU/MAU, session length, retention cohorts, LTV, CAC, virality/engagement trends over the last 6\u201312 months.\n- If metrics are stable or growing, that argues against a panic pivot.\n\n4. Run quick, cheap tests before a big change\n- User interviews / contextual inquiry with a representative sample of teens (and parents if relevant).\n- Surveys to detect behavior shifts and unmet needs.\n- Small product experiments or landing\u2011page tests for the alternate demographic to measure interest and CAC before committing resources.\n- A small beta or \u201cexplorer\u201d branch targeting the new demo, run for a limited time with clear success metrics.\n\n5. Build a decision framework and timeline\n- Define the evidence that would justify a pivot (e.g., sustained 20% decline in teen MAU for 3 months; CAC>2x LTV; external market shift confirmed by multiple sources).\n- Agree on a timeline and \u201cguardrails\u201d (how much runway/time you\u2019ll spend exploring before making a final call).\n\n6. If you must change course, do it incrementally\n- Consider dual-track: keep the core teen product while piloting features or a new offering for another demographic.\n- Reuse learnings, tech, and content where possible to avoid throwing away value.\n- Protect your runway\u2014don\u2019t reallocate the majority of resources without tests and validated learning.\n\nConversation script (concise)\n- \u201cThanks for flagging that article\u2014can you walk me through the specific risks you see it creating for our product? Let\u2019s gather the data and run a few quick tests before we decide on a big pivot.\u201d\n- Propose timeline and next steps: \u201cLet\u2019s review three credible datasets this week, run 10 user interviews, and launch a 4\u2011week landing\u2011page test for the alternative demographic. If the results meet predefined criteria, we re-evaluate.\u201d\n\nWhen a hard pushback/pivot is justified\n- Multiple independent data sources show sustained decline for the teen segment, AND\n- Your internal product metrics are declining despite retention/engagement fixes, OR\n- Competitive/ regulatory/monetization changes make the teen model nonviable, AND\n- Your runway or investor expectations force a quick GTM shift.\n\nWhen pushing back hard would be justified\n- Your co\u2011founder insists on an all\u2011in pivot based solely on one article/headline without running the basic checks above.\n- They start reallocating resources or changing roadmap without team alignment or agreed criteria.\n\nFinal note\nThis is more of a partnership and process issue than a pure product one. Treat the moment as an opportunity to establish a repeatable decision process: assess data, run cheap experiments, and agree on objective criteria for big moves.

Below are the strongest reasons you could be wrong, followed by concrete indicators that should make you exit the position early (and practical risk-management triggers).\n\nWhy you might be wrong (the strongest/most likely reversal paths)\n- Cohort replacement and population dynamics\n  - New cohorts of teens will replace older ones; small declines in per\u2011teen usage can be offset if teen population or smartphone penetration holds steady or increases.\n- Platform/product innovation and habit retention\n  - A platform launches features (short video, AR, games, integrated commerce, AI personalization) that restore or grow time spent among teens.\n- Rapid monetization improvements\n  - The company increases ARPU through better ad formats, shopping/ad shoppable features, or subscriptions; even with slightly lower usage, revenue can rise.\n- Shift from active to passive engagement that still monetizes\n  - Teens might reduce posting but still watch lots of content \u2014 which still generates ad impressions and CPMs.\n- Measurement, attribution, and SDK/first\u2011party improvements\n  - Better measurement or a pivot to first\u2011party signals (server\u2011side tracking, identity graphs) can restore targeted ad value even with privacy headwinds.\n- Market consolidation/competitive exits\n  - Competitors lose teen users or fail to monetize, consolidating teen engagement on the company you\u2019re shorting.\n- International or non\u2011teen revenue cushions\n  - The ad\u2011tech firm diversifies or grows non\u2011US and non\u2011teen revenue streams fast enough to offset US teen declines.\n- Macro/advertiser demand surprises\n  - Ad budgets shift toward the platform because of better ROAS, lower CPMs elsewhere, or industry campaign trends (e.g., big seasonal spends, political/ad cycles).\n- Regulatory or technical reversals\n  - Expected privacy/regulatory constraints that would hurt targeting don\u2019t materialize, or enforcement laxity lets targeting continue.\n- M&A or strategic partnerships\n  - The company is acquired at a premium or signs distribution/partnership deals that materially improve monetization.\n\nConcrete indicators that should trigger an early exit\n(organize into user, revenue/ad, advertiser, corporate, and market/technical signals)\n\nUser/engagement metrics (leading)\n- DAU/MAU for the teen cohort: if teen DAU stabilizes or grows quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) by >3\u20135% for two consecutive quarters, reassess; treat a single positive quarter cautiously.\n- Average time spent per teen/day: a reversal from decline to flat or rising for two quarters is a strong signal.\n- Retention/cohort survival: 7\u2011 and 30\u2011day retention improving or cohort decay slowing materially.\n- Net new installs and active device counts for the core app(s): persistent growth in teen-geared app installs (Sensor Tower, App Annie reports).\n\nRevenue/ad metrics (direct monetization)\n- Teen ARPU or ad impressions attributable to teens: sustained growth or flatness vs your modeled decline.\n- CPMs and fill rates: rising CPMs or fill rates (improved price or demand) for 2+ quarters.\n- Total ad revenue vs guidance: revenue beats or upward guidance revisions tied to ad demand from teen-relevant products.\n- ROAS/engagement metrics reported to advertisers improving (e.g., click-through, conversion).\n\nAdvertiser/market demand signals\n- Advertiser count/retention: the number of active advertisers or top-spend brands remains stable or grows.\n- Proportion of ad dollars from performance/brand categories that value teen audiences rises or holds.\n- Agency commentary and buy patterns: increased programmatic bids or share-of-wallet toward the platform.\n\nCorporate/strategic signals\n- Successful product launches targeted at teens (documented adoption metrics).\n- Diversification: significant and sustained revenue share from non\u2011teen or non\u2011US sources that reduce dependence on US teen engagement.\n- Partnerships/M&A that plausibly raise monetization (distribution deals, commerce partnerships).\n- Insider buying, major strategic investments, or long\u2011term enterprise contracts inconsistent with your revenue downgrade.\n\nMarket/technical signs and short-specific risks\n- Borrow/short squeeze signals:\n  - Borrow fee spikes (e.g., borrow cost rising meaningfully toward double digits percent annualized): increases short carrying cost and signals demand to buy back.\n  - Borrow recall notices or dramatic fall in available shares to borrow.\n  - Short interest falls sharply (large covering by other shorts or institutions).\n- Options and market price action:\n  - Large call volume/open interest concentrated at strikes above current price, sudden implied volatility increases.\n- Stock price action:\n  - Share price rallies >15\u201325% with volume and without a temporary news explanation \u2014 consider trimming or hedging.\n- Analyst upgrades, positive earnings surprise, or guidance hikes that persist for two quarters.\n\nHow to convert those indicators into exit rules (practical triggers)\n- Fundamental exit triggers (preferred)\n  - Two consecutive quarters where teen DAU or time spent stops declining and shows QoQ growth \u22653%, OR\n  - Two consecutive quarters of revenue or ad revenue beating guidance driven by ad demand metrics tied to teens, OR\n  - Material strategic shift: the company announces and demonstrates (metrics) a credible diversification that reduces teen-reliance (e.g., >20% revenue from new segment).\n- Risk/market technical exit triggers (short-specific)\n  - Borrow cost rises above a pre-set threshold (example: >30% annualized) or borrow availability falls to near-zero \u2192 cover or hedge immediately.\n  - Stock price increase of X% (tailor X to your risk tolerance; common choices are 15\u201325%) in a short time frame without fundamental deterioration \u2014 cut size or buy protection.\n  - Sudden large purchases by insiders/strategic investors or acquisition rumors \u2014 consider exit or hedge.\n- Time-based reevaluation\n  - If thesis depends on multi-year trends, set calendar checks (every quarter) to re-evaluate the data vs model; don\u2019t wait until 2028 to react.\n\nPractical risk management / hedging suggestions\n- Use position sizing so a short squeeze won\u2019t cause catastrophic loss; have stop\u2011loss or pre\u2011defined loss-limit.\n- Consider buying calls or call spreads as protection if the borrow cost is reasonable.\n- Diversify short exposure across several names to avoid single-stock squeeze risk.\n- Keep a dashboard tracking the key metrics above (DAU by cohort, time spent, CPM, ad revenue, borrow fee, short interest, installs).\n\nData sources to monitor\n- Company earnings/MD&A, 8\u2011K/10\u2011K/10\u2011Q disclosures (cohort metrics, ARPU, ARPA).\n- Mobile measurement firms: Sensor Tower, App Annie; Comscore and Nielsen for audience measurement.\n- Industry reports: eMarketer, Pew Research, Common Sense Media for macro teen usage trends.\n- Programmatic/ad exchanges and DSP/agency reports for CPM and ad spend shifts.\n- Broker/dealer borrow desks and short interest reports for borrow cost and availability.\n\nQuick example exit plan (illustrative)\n- Cut position by 50% if borrow cost >25% annualized or available borrow <10% of your size.\n- Close full position if teen DAU grows QoQ \u22655% for two consecutive quarters OR if company reports two consecutive beats driven by ad demand with upward guidance.\n- Hedge (buy calls) if price rises 15% from your entry and fundamentals have not yet deteriorated \u2014 tighten thereafter.\n\nSummary\nThe biggest reasons you could be wrong are product/monetization fixes, cohort replacement, measurement/pivot to first\u2011party signals, and advertiser demand that offsets lower per\u2011teen time. Watch user-engagement cohorts, ad revenue/CPM trends, advertiser behavior, and short-specific technical indicators (borrow cost/availability and price/volatility action).

Remedies, Credits and Adjustments\n- If renegotiation results in termination under Section 5, Provider will refund to Client any prepaid but unearned fees for services not performed, less reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in good faith.\n- If a Sustained Shift is the result of a platform change or external factor outside Provider\u2019s reasonable control (e.g., platform algorithm change, policy change, or major demographic shift), Parties will allocate financial adjustments equitably (e.g., fee reduction, increased performance window, reallocation of paid media) taking into account documented efforts to mitigate impact.\n- If a Sustained Positive Shift (improvement) meets the Renegotiation Thresholds, Parties shall renegotiate to agree on additional compensation or incentive structure to account for materially higher-than-expected performance (e.g., performance bonus, increased scope, revenue share) within the same time periods and procedures in Section 5.\n\n7. Interim Optimization and Good\u2011Faith Efforts\n- Upon any variance notice, Provider shall deliver a remedial optimization plan within [7] business days describing corrective actions, expected timeline and projected impact.\n- Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the plan. Client shall cooperate (e.g., approve creative changes, shift paid spend) as reasonably requested to address variance.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n- Variances attributable to Client\u2019s actions (e.g., delayed approvals, creative directions, pausing paid media) will not trigger renegotiation rights in favor of Client. The Parties shall document causal attribution where relevant.\n- Any adjustment to Fees or Deliverables shall be set forth in a written amendment signed by both Parties.\n- This clause does not limit any other termination or remedy rights set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\nRecommended metric thresholds (summary)\n- Minor variance (monitor + optimization): \u00b110\u201324% for one Measurement Period.\n- Moderate variance (formal renegotiation): \u00b125\u201349% sustained (2 consecutive months or 1 quarter).\n- Major variance (material remedy or termination right): \u00b150% or more sustained.\n\nRecommended measurement and governance practices\n- Establish Baseline using either: (a) recent historical comparable campaign data (same audience/platform), or (b) the first [90] days of the Campaign Term (documented and mutually agreed).\n- Use platform-native metrics and a named third-party measurement provider if possible for objectivity.\n- Require demographic verification for teen audience share (platform-provided age breakdown), and include a minimum % of teen audience (e.g., at least [X%] of engaged users must be age 13\u201317) as a separate KPI if reaching teens is essential.\n- Report monthly with quarterly business reviews to assess trends and avoid knee\u2011jerk reactions to normal variability.\n\nPractical notes\n- For teen campaigns, prioritize metrics that show audience quality (percentage of teen audience, conversion to youth-specific actions) rather than vanity metrics alone.\n- Consider including both absolute thresholds (e.g., fewer than [X] conversions/month) and relative thresholds (percentage variance) so very small baselines don\u2019t create frequent renegotiation triggers.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Insert concrete example thresholds and dates based on your risk tolerance (conservative vs. aggressive).\n- Draft a short exhibit that defines exact measurement formulas for Engagement Rate, Conversion Rate, CPA, etc.\n- Convert this into a simple amendment form ready to attach to your agreement.\n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer.

Those forces can push usage up, down, or sideways\u2014often unpredictably.  \n- Recent years showed rapid platform churn (e.g., Snapchat -> Instagram Reels -> TikTok) and big changes in time use; behavior typically shifts platform-by-platform, not simply \u201cdeclines.\u201d  \n- Empirical forecasts require transparent data, clear modeling, and tested assumptions (cohort vs period effects, technology diffusion curves, regulatory impacts). A one-line prediction with no evidence is weak.  \n- Even if general prevalence declines in the long run, that doesn\u2019t guarantee harms (distraction, cyberbullying, sleep disruption, inequitable access to support) will vanish or that school contexts won\u2019t be affected in the interim.\n\nQuestions to ask the consultant (demand evidence)\n- What data sources underpin the forecast (surveys, device telemetry, cohort studies)? Time range? Sample representativeness?  \n- What is the causal mechanism for the decline? (e.g., regulatory bans, platform collapse, cohort maturation?) Why will it happen by 2028 specifically?  \n- Is the model forecasting overall screen time, smartphone ownership, active social-media use, or something else?  \n- How does the model handle platform churn and substitution effects (students switching apps rather than stopping)?  \n- What are the confidence intervals and error rates of the forecast? Has this model successfully predicted similar social trends?  \n- How should the district hedge if the prediction is wrong?\n\nPractical risks of trusting the prediction now\n- If use and harms continue or increase, rolling back protections could lead to more classroom disruption, safety incidents, distraction, and liability.  \n- Equity concern: students with less home support may be more harmed by increased access during school.  \n- You lose a monitoring baseline once you remove restrictions, making it harder to measure change later.\n\nRecommended decision process (practical steps)\n1. Don\u2019t make a unilateral rollback. Treat the consultant\u2019s claim as one data point, not proof.  \n2. Require the consultant to produce their data, model and a written rationale. Peer-review it internally or with a neutral third party.  \n3. Gather local baseline data now (before any change):  \n   - Student self-reported device/social use during and outside school.  \n   - Teacher reports on classroom distraction and device misuse.  \n   - Discipline referrals tied to phones/social media, attendance, academic metrics, and wellness referrals.  \n4. Define clear goals/metrics for any policy change (e.g., improve access to digital resources without increasing classroom distraction; reduce off-task device use by X%).  \n5. Pilot any relaxation in a small, measured way (one grade, one school, or specific time windows) with explicit evaluation criteria and a predetermined rollback clause.  \n6. Monitor continuously (monthly/quarterly) on pre-specified metrics. If negative outcomes cross agreed thresholds, revert quickly.  \n7. Keep protective practices in place while testing: teacher training, digital citizenship curriculum, explicit classroom norms, supervised device use, and technical controls (managed Wi\u2011Fi, filtered access during class periods).  \n8. Engage stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, counselors) in design and evaluation.\n\nSuggested metrics/thresholds for rollback/pilot decisions\n- Classroom disruption incidents attributable to phones increase by >20% over baseline in one quarter.  \n- Teacher-reported \u201cfrequent\u201d off-task device use rises by >15% vs baseline.  \n- Measurable negative impacts on attendance, grades, or mental-health referrals exceeding pre-set limits.  \n- Student self-reports show no increase in cyberbullying or sleep problems.  \n(Adjust thresholds to district priorities; require sustained trends, not single-month blips.)\n\nAlternative, lower-risk policy changes to consider instead of full rollback\n- Allow limited, structured access (e.g., laptop/tablet carts for classwork; phones in lockers during class but allowed during lunch).  \n- Create \u201cphone zones\u201d and supervised times.  \n- Strengthen digital-literacy and social-emotional programs.  \n- Use technical solutions: classroom device management, site-blocking during lessons, or \u201cfocus\u201d modes.  \n- Run a time-limited pilot with strong evaluation before any district-wide change.\n\nBottom line\nA blanket rollback based on \u201cit will go away by 2028\u201d is not prudent.

Here\u2019s a structured, evidence-based case and a practical plan you can present to the CMO so the decision is owned by data \u2014 not a hunch.\n\nKey argument (one line)\n- Teens are not abandoning social media; they\u2019re shifting platforms and formats. For teen-focused products, social channels are the primary place culture, discovery and purchase intent are formed \u2014 pull budget only if experiments prove it, don\u2019t guess.\n\nHow to make the case (talking points)\n- Teens remain a heavy digital-social cohort. Multiple independent research sources (Pew Research, Common Sense Media, platform reports) show continued high usage and rapid platform churn. The risk is not that teens aren\u2019t on social media, it\u2019s that they move quickly between apps \u2014 and brands that leave lose cultural relevance.\n- Social is the most efficient way to reach and influence this cohort: discovery (short-form video), creator endorsements, and in-app commerce are core teen behaviors.\n- Cutting spend now is a strategic error: losing mindshare with a generation is expensive to recover. Re-entry costs and the time needed to rebuild creator relationships and algorithmic favor are high.\n- If the concern is ROI or fatigue, solve for measurement and creative, not for channel elimination.\n\nAsk for the CMO\u2019s evidence and offer a test\n- Ask the CMO: what evidence shows a sustained reduction in teen social media usage that justifies a dramatic cut?\n- Propose a compromise: instead of a large arbitrary reduction, run a controlled experiment (details below) and base any structural cuts on actual incrementality and cohort-level LTV results.\n\nPractical roadmap to present (2\u20136 month plan)\n1) Protect a brand-sustaining baseline\n   - Maintain a core social budget to preserve presence and creator relationships. Recommendation: do not cut below ~60\u201380% of current social spend until experiments finish. (Exact % you can adjust to internal tolerance.)\n2) Reallocate to higher-return tactics\n   - Shift toward short-form video, creator partnerships, micro-influencers, and platform-native formats (TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, Roblox/Twitch where relevant).\n   - Prioritize UGC-style creative and performance campaigns that drive measured conversions.\n3) Run an incrementality test\n   - Set up holdout markets or randomized geo/ID-level holdouts. Maintain normal activity in test markets, pull or reduce spend in holdout markets.\n   - Run for a full sales cycle (recommend 8\u201312 weeks minimum) capturing brand lift, conversion lift and downstream LTV.\n   - Measure against control: incremental sales, CAC, ROAS, lift in awareness/consideration.\n4) Concurrent measurement & insight\n   - Use a combination of brand-lift surveys, in-app analytics, and econometric / MMM methods to validate short- and medium-term impact.\n   - Track platform-level signals (view-through, time in app, creator engagement) and first-party signals (email/SMS opt-ins, app installs).\n5) Iterate & decide\n   - If incremental ROI is strong \u2192 maintain or increase spend. If weak but creative/audience mismatch is the issue \u2192 reallocate to different creators/formats and retest. If truly low incremental value \u2192 plan phased de-risked cut with re-entry plan.\n\nWhat to measure (KPIs and how to interpret them)\n- Leading indicators: share of voice, impressions among teens, CPM, CTR/engagement rate, video completion rate, follower growth, creator reach.\n- Mid-funnel: website/app traffic from teen cohort, add-to-cart, coupon redemptions, opt-ins.\n- Bottom-funnel: CAC for teen cohort, conversion rate, CR by channel, short-term ROAS.\n- Incrementality: sales lift vs holdout, brand-lift survey (aided/un-aided awareness), and 90\u2013180 day LTV of teen cohort.\n- Decision rules: set thresholds for acceptable CAC/ROAS and minimum measurable incremental lift before making permanent cuts.\n\nTactical ideas that lower risk and increase ROI\n- Creator-first strategy: long-term creator relationships, performance-based deals, exclusives and product seeding.\n- Micro-influencers and community creators: lower CPMs, high authenticity, better conversion for discovery-driven products.\n- Platform-native commerce: in-app shopping, shoppable videos, and links to app install flows.\n- Gaming & virtual worlds: sponsorships, branded rooms/skins/events on Roblox/Fortnite for product discovery.\n- Organic + paid synergy: amplify viral organic posts with paid boosts for efficient reach.\n- First-party data capture: use social to drive teen opt-ins for SMS/app push, then own the relationship.\n- Creative testing: 10\u201320 creative variants, optimize to top performers quickly (creative fatigue is a larger issue than channel availability).\n\nCounterpoints to likely CMO concerns\n- \u201cTeens are using social less\u201d \u2014 Ask for their source; propose the experiment as the evidence-seeking route. If true, it will show up in reduced engagement/CTR and in the held-out markets comparison.\n- \u201cWe need to cut costs now\u201d \u2014 Offer a targeted efficiency program: reduce low-performing placements, shift to performance and creator-based deals, but keep the baseline so brand equity doesn\u2019t erode.\n- \u201cWe need more measurable channels\u201d \u2014 Modern social measurement supports both short-term conversion tracking and brand lift/incrementality testing. Use them before structural changes.\n\nSample slide bullets for your meeting\n- \u201cWhy we can\u2019t just cut social: risk of lost relevance and high re-entry costs for teen cohort.\u201d\n- \u201cData-backed compromise: maintain baseline, run controlled incrementality test, reallocate to higher-ROI formats.\u201d\n- \u201cTesting plan: holdout vs test markets, 8\u201312 weeks, measure incremental sales + 90-day LTV.\u201d\n- \u201cTactical moves: creator-first, short-form video, micro-influencers, gaming partnerships, first-party data capture.\u201d\n- \u201cDecision milestones: continue, optimize or phase reduction based on measurable incremental lift.\u201d\n\nFinal ask to the CMO (closing)\n- Propose a short-term commitment: preserve baseline spending for X months (suggest 3\u20136), run the incrementality test, and agree to a decision rule tied to outcomes. If results show true decline in value, cut then \u2014 but don\u2019t accept a blanket reduction without evidence.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft the two-slide memo / deck for the CMO with the test design and decision rules.\n- Sketch a detailed experiment plan (sample audiences, sample sizes, metrics, timeline) tailored to your current spend levels and markets.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.05, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly argues that teens are not abandoning social media and remain a 'heavy digital-social cohort,' emphasizing platform/format shifts rather than overall decline.

Tailor to your business sensitivity.\n3. Run financial sensitivity\n   - Recalculate revenue, CAC payback, and runway under decline. Identify breakpoints (cash depletion dates, burn ratio thresholds).\n4. Specify leading indicators & triggers\n   - Examples: DAU/MAU drops >10% QoQ; 7-day retention down 15% vs. baseline; organic install rate halves; average sessions per DAU drops 20%; CAC rises >X% and ROAS falls below target.\n   - Assign owners and monitoring cadence.\n5. Create an actionable playbook per trigger (3 buckets)\n   - Rapid response (0\u20133 months): hiring freeze, pause noncritical spending, migration communications, retention blitz (push/promo), prioritize bug fixes and core UX, freeze feature rollouts that increase costs.\n   - Stabilization (3\u20139 months): refocus roadmap to retention and reactivation features, cut or pause low-return experiments, renegotiate vendor costs, reduce moderation scale or automate more safely, test new monetization or community verticals.\n   - Strategic pivot/exit (>9 months): explore M&A, pivot to adjacent cohorts or B2B opportunities, product pivot (e.g., tools for creators), or controlled wind-down plan.\n6. Prioritize roadmap items by value vs. cost\n   - High impact/low cost: retention loops, onboarding improvements, re-engagement flows, creator incentives.  \n   - High cost/low impact: large new features that require heavy moderation or costly scale.\n7. Communication & governance\n   - Predefine decision rights: who signs off on hiring freeze, budget cuts, big pivots.  \n   - Share scenario with investors/board and key teams so responses aren\u2019t ad hoc.\n\nKPIs to monitor (leading & diagnostic)\n- Acquisition: organic installs, paid install efficiency (CAC, ROAS)  \n- Engagement: DAU, MAU, DAU/MAU ratio, sessions per DAU, session length  \n- Retention: day 1/7/30 retention, cohort LTV  \n- Virality: K-factor, invite/share rates  \n- Monetization: ARPU/DAU, ad RPM, conversion rates  \n- Community health: content creation rate, moderator workload per user, trust & safety incidents, NPS/sentiment  \n- External signals: competitor installs, app store ratings, youth culture trends\n\nHow much effort to invest now\n- Build the scenario and a compact playbook now (1\u20132 weeks of cross-functional work).  \n- Maintain a lightweight dashboard for leading indicators.  \n- Full contingency execution plans only for triggers that are reached \u2014 you don\u2019t need a multi-year alternate roadmap until metrics start to drift.\n\nTypical roadmap changes under decline (examples)\n- Pause expansion/new markets; double down on core market retention.  \n- Delay big new features; prioritize low-cost retention fixes and automation.  \n- Reduce paid UA and invest in organic/community programs.  \n- Optimize costs: outsource/noncritical roles, slow hiring, renegotiate contracts.  \n- Explore alternative monetization (subscriptions, creator tools, licensing).  \n- Prepare communications plan for users and creators if features are reduced.\n\nFinal recommendation\nInclude a structured decline scenario with:\n- Defined drivers and quantified impact,\n- A short, actionable trigger-based playbook (rapid, stabilizing, strategic stages),\n- Regular monitoring of a small set of leading KPIs,\n- Quarterly reassessment and pre-authorized decision rules.\n\nThis gives you the discipline to act quickly and proportionately if usage turns down \u2014 without overengineering a full alternate roadmap until it\u2019s needed.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.7, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly recommends including a decline scenario and treats declines as a realistic contingency\u2014listing plausible drivers, providing example decline magnitudes (e.g., 15\u201340% YoY MAU decline or 10% QoQ drops), and prescribing concrete triggers and playbooks.

Waiting until you see a big drop will make pivoting harder and more expensive.\n\nPractical plan (timeline + actions)\n\nImmediate (0\u20131 month)\n- Audit: pull platform analytics (age, watch time, retention, CPMs, churn) and revenue sources. Know exactly how much you rely on teens and which content formats perform best.\n- Start owning your audience: set up or improve email list, Discord/Telegram, and a simple landing page/shop.

Choose based on analytics overlaps or interests your current content already touches.\n- Lightweight content tests:\n  - Repurpose 2\u20133 top teen-performing pieces with edits that appeal to older viewers (different hooks, slightly more context, deeper insight).\n  - Produce an \u201cevergreen\u201d explainer or how-to aimed at older viewers (career skills, life hacks, nostalgia).\n  - Collaborate with 1\u20132 creators who have the demo you want.\n- Paid audience tests: small ad campaigns targeting new age brackets to measure conversion/follower cost and engagement.\n- Track KPIs: new followers by demo, watch time, retention, engagement rate, CPM/CPV, revenue per follower.\n\nMedium term (6\u201318 months) \u2014 decide and scale\n- Evaluate experiments quarterly. Scale what works (increase production, collaborations, platform presence).\n- Build 1\u20132 alternative monetization streams: newsletter-paid tier, merch targeted to new demo, memberships (Patreon/OnlyFans alternatives), affiliate partnerships, digital product (course, template).\n- Continue maintaining teen-first content cadence to avoid alienating your current base. Consider a deliberate content split (e.g., 70% core, 30% experiments) and adjust as earnings shift.\n\nLonger term (18\u201336 months)\n- If new demos prove viable, hire or outsource to scale production and community management.\n- Move more revenue to owned channels (email, direct subscriptions, product sales) so platform audience shifts have less impact.\n- Revisit positioning and brand messaging to incorporate broader appeal without losing authenticity.\n\nSignals to accelerate diversification\n- Sustained decline in teen engagement: e.g., \u226515% drop in reach/engagement for two consecutive quarters.\n- Rising CPMs or declining ad revenue per impression that cut into margins.\n- Platform policy changes or algorithm shifts that reduce discoverability.\n- Analytics showing a growing share of older viewers who convert better (higher LTV).\n\nWhen diversification could be premature\n- If teen metrics are stable/growing and experiments cost more than your current ROI, don\u2019t overhaul your brand. Keep tests small and reversible.\n- Avoid wholesale repositioning that would alienate your core audience unless the data forces your hand.\n\nContent and channel ideas (low-friction)\n- Slightly older audience (18\u201324 / 25\u201334): deeper dives, \u201cwhat I wish I knew,\u201d career tips, monetization/side-hustle content, nostalgia angles (early 2010s).\n- Parents of teens: safety, communication tips, gifting guides, parenting humor.\n- Owned formats: weekly newsletter, repackaged YouTube-longform from shorts, paid micro-courses, merch drops.\n- Channels: continue core platforms, add YouTube for discoverability/longer content, email + Discord for retention, Etsy/shopify for merch, LinkedIn only if your content has career/skill value.\n\nRisk management and ethics\n- Don\u2019t alienate kids by suddenly making content explicitly for adults. Be transparent with your audience when you experiment.\n- Follow COPPA and platform ad rules when producing or monetizing content aimed at minors.\n- Keep some content evergreen to smooth revenue volatility.\n\nQuick checklist to start today\n- Export audience demographics and revenue breakdown.\n- Create a one-page plan: which demo to test, what content, what ad budget, success criteria.\n- Set up or clean your email capture and Discord.\n- Run 2 small experiments this month (one organic, one with small paid boost).\n- Review results in 4\u20138 weeks and iterate.\n\nBottom line: Diversify now in measured steps.

The safer approach is a middle path: don\u2019t wait; make a plan that respects your teen\u2019s needs while reducing harmful patterns and monitoring effects.\n\nWhy:\n- Research shows heavy social-media use in teens is associated with worse sleep, increased anxiety/depression symptoms, attention problems, and poorer school performance. Causality is mixed and effects vary by teen, type of use (passive scrolling is worse than active messaging), and content.\n- Some teens do reduce use as they get older; others do not. There\u2019s no guarantee a high-use pattern will resolve on its own \u2014 and while you wait you risk sleep loss, mood problems, academic fallout, or habit formation that\u2019s harder to change later.\n\nWhat to do now (practical plan you can implement tomorrow)\n1. Assess context quickly\n   - Ask: What apps? When are they using it (before bed, during homework, in class)? Who are they connecting with? How does it affect mood, sleep, grades, friendships?\n   - Watch for red flags: big mood shifts, withdrawal from family/old hobbies, falling grades, angry reactions to limits, using social media late into the night.\n\n2. Start with a couple of high-impact, low-conflict rules\n   - Device-free bedroom at night and charge devices outside the bedroom (set a curfew).\n   - No screens during homework or family meals.\n   - Turn off nonessential notifications and remove addictive auto-play features.\n\n3. Use tools and measurable goals\n   - Enable native screen-time limits or third-party apps to set daily limits and enforce bed curfews.\n   - Agree on a realistic, time-bound reduction (for example: reduce by 1 hour/day this month) and track progress.\n\n4. Make it collaborative and empathetic\n   - Don\u2019t simply punish. Explain concerns (sleep, grades, mood) and ask the teen for their perspective and ideas.\n   - Negotiate rewards and privileges tied to responsibilities (sports, social time, hobbies).\n   - Offer alternatives: organized activities, social events, chores, creative projects, in-person hangouts.\n\n5. Focus on the underlying needs\n   - Many teens use social media for social connection, boredom relief, or anxiety management. Help them find healthier ways to meet those needs (peer groups, extracurriculars, counseling if needed).\n\n6. Monitor and revisit\n   - Set a 2\u20134 week trial, review changes in sleep, mood, and school, and adjust the plan.\n   - If limits produce severe conflict or the teen hides use and mood worsens, consider family counseling.\n\nHow to handle disagreement with your partner\n- Propose a data-driven trial: \u201cLet\u2019s try a 3-week device-curfew and see if sleep/grades/mood improve; if there\u2019s no harm we can relax it.\u201d\n- Use neutral language: focus on behaviors and outcomes rather than blame.\n- If your partner resists, suggest starting with the least invasive changes (bedtime charging, no phones at dinner) that have big benefits and are easier to gain agreement on.\n\nWhen to seek professional help now\n- If you see suicidal talk, self-harm, big drops in functioning, severe anxiety/depression, or signs of addiction (inability to stop despite harm), contact your pediatrician or a mental-health professional promptly.\n\nResources\n- American Academy of Pediatrics Family Media Plan and Common Sense Media are practical, family-friendly guides to create rules together.\n\nBottom line: Don\u2019t ignore 5+ hours/day \u2014 act now with reasonable, enforceable, collaborative limits, measure results, and escalate to counseling if needed.

Time horizon: through 2028.\n\nThesis summary\nU.S. teen daily usage of public, observable social platforms is likely to decline materially from current levels through 2028. That decline will disproportionately damage companies that (a) monetize primarily through U.S. ad sales, (b) depend on teens for high engagement/time-spent, and (c) lack diversified revenue streams (payments/gaming/B2B). Expect lower ad impressions, falling CPMs for teen-skewed inventory, higher content-moderation and compliance costs, and increasing churn \u2014 all compressing top-line growth and margins, which is not fully priced into the valuations of several teen-focused names.\n\nWhy teen usage will fall (key drivers)\n- Regulatory tailwinds: Growing federal and state momentum for age verification, data-minimization, and targeted-ad restrictions for minors will raise compliance costs and limit personalized ad targeting for under\u201118 users. Implementation and enforcement will accelerate over the next 24\u201348 months.\n- Parental/school pushback & platform restrictions: Parents, schools, and platforms are implementing time limits, usage monitoring, and restricted access, reducing daily active usage and session length among teens.\n- Platform fatigue and migration: Teens are shifting to private, ephemeral, or non-ad-supported spaces (closed messaging, invite-only apps, gaming platforms) that are harder to monetize; network effects for mass, public social feeds weaken.\n- Societal concerns & media scrutiny: Mental health and safety scandals will spur temporary or permanent disengagement and brand boycotts by teen cohorts.\n- Advertising mix and privacy headwinds: Continued privacy reforms (post-ATT effects) reduce ad targeting effectiveness for youth demo, lowering CPMs and advertiser willingness to pay for teen inventory.\n\nAssumptions & modeled impact (illustrative)\n- Base assumption: U.S. teen daily usage of targeted platforms declines 20% by 2028 from today\u2019s levels.\n- Downside scenario: 35\u201340% decline (aggressive regulation + rapid migration to private spaces).\n- Revenue sensitivity: For a teen-focused platform where U.S. teens contribute 30\u201350% of ad impressions/engagement, a 20% decline in teen usage could translate to an ~10\u201320% revenue decline (mix and CPM effects), and a 35% usage decline could imply a ~18\u201335% revenue hit, before any offsetting price increases or international growth.\n- Margin impact: Fixed costs (moderation, R&D) and higher compliance spend mean EBITDA margin compression >100\u2013300 basis points for moderate declines, larger for downside.\n\nCatalysts (near-to-medium term)\n- Passage or enforcement of federal/state youth data protection laws (age verification, limits on targeted ads).\n- Major advertiser reallocations away from teen inventory following industry guidance or high-profile incidents.\n- Quarterly user metrics showing declines in 13\u201317 daily active users (DAU) or time spent.\n- Earnings calls downgrading ad-direct-response or CPM guidance tied to teen segments.\n\nShort candidates / selection criteria\nPrefer shorts where multiple criteria are met:\n- High percent of U.S. DAUs from teens (\u226525\u201330%).\n- Heavy reliance on ad revenue with limited diversification.\n- Elevated valuation metrics (high forward EV/Revenue or P/S) that assume sustained engagement growth.\n- Weak free cash flow or high operating leverage.\n\nExecution & risk management\n- Use protective structures: buy puts, cash-secured puts with defined risk, or pair trades (short teen-focused stock vs. long broader ad revenue/large-cap social with diversification).\n- Position sizing: keep initial exposure small relative to portfolio; scale into confirmed deterioration in teen metrics.\n- Monitoring: weekly/monthly DAU/time-spent by age cohort (company disclosures, third-party panels), advertiser guidance, regulatory headlines, CPM trends, and churn rates among new teen cohorts.\n- Exit triggers: positive surprises \u2014 company guidance materially above consensus, evidence of successful monetization of other cohorts offsetting teen declines, or regulatory rollback.\n\nRisks / mitigants\n- Offset by international growth: Many platforms can offset U.S. teen declines with growth abroad; limit shorts to U.S.-centric teen plays or adjust revenue-sensitivity assumptions.\n- Re-monetization & product pivots: Companies may successfully monetize private or gaming-adjacent spaces; mitigate with monitoring and flexible sizing.\n- Short squeezes and volatility: Use limited-risk options and maintain liquidity.\n- Teens reverse course: Cultural trends can reverse; only increase allocation on confirmed multi-quarter deterioration.\n\nBottom line\nThe combination of regulatory pressure, parental/school controls, privacy headwinds, and behavioral shifts points to a meaningful decline in U.S. teen daily usage through 2028. That secular trend will disproportionately damage high\u2011multiple, teen-dependent social platforms.

Push for flexibility \u2014 a mix of performance-based pricing, guaranteed minimums at a discounted CPM, and explicit downtick / renegotiation mechanics tied to verified teen usage and engagement. That balances downside risk if teen usage falls with publisher incentives to deliver quality inventory.\n\nWhy\n- Teen usage is the key demand driver. If MAUs/engagement fall, impressions and attention for teen-targeted inventory (and thus value) will likely drop.\n- Locking into fixed premium CPMs for 2026\u201328 risks overpaying. Pure performance pricing shifts most risk to publishers but isn\u2019t always feasible for awareness campaigns.\n- Hybrid deals keep publishers motivated to supply and optimize while protecting your spend.\n\nPractical negotiation approach (concise roadmap)\n1. Segment by campaign objective\n   - Direct response (measurable actions): push for CPC/CPA/CPI or hybrid CPC+CPM.\n   - Brand/awareness: use CPMs but attach performance clauses (VTR, viewability, attention metrics) and audience guarantees.\n2. Use short terms and re-opener clauses\n   - Prefer 6\u201312 month firm terms with options to renew rather than locking 3 years at one rate.\n   - Add mandatory renegotiation/price-adjust clauses at each renewal tied to independent teen-usage indicators.\n3. Build a hybrid pricing model\n   - Guaranteed minimum impressions at a reduced CPM (protects baseline reach).\n   - Performance layer: lower base CPM + bonus/overage paid on conversions/engagement or pay-as-you-go for high-performing inventory.\n   - Example: 60% of spend on guaranteed CPM at X% discount vs today; 40% on performance (CPI/CPC).\n4. Add explicit fallbacks tied to teen-usage metrics\n   - Define the teen-usage metric (publisher MAU, third-party panel, e.g., Comscore/Pew, or agreed measurement).\n   - Step-down rule: if teen MAU/share declines by >Y% vs baseline, publisher reduces CPM by Z% (or issues pro rata credit).\n   - Minimum credits for shortfall in \u201cverified teen impressions\u201d (not just impressions served).\n5. KPIs and verification\n   - Require third-party verification (Moat/IAS/DoubleVerify or agreed measurement partner) for viewability, invalid traffic (IVT), and teen audience composition.\n   - Specify KPI thresholds (e.g., viewability \u226570%, VTR \u2265X% for video) and credits/renegotiation if missed.\n6. Makegoods & credits\n   - Pro rata credits for under-delivery of guaranteed teen impressions or KPl shortfalls; avoid vague \u201cbest-effort\u201d language.\n   - Limit makegoods to a single extension period (e.g., 30 days) or explicit credit formula.\n7. Performance bonuses/penalties\n   - Incentivize over-performance with fixed bonuses; penalize systematic audience-mismatch or fraud with credits/termination rights.\n8. Testing & pilot\n   - Insist on a 3\u20136 month pilot at performance pricing or reduced CPM to validate inventory quality/teen reach before committing long term.\n9. Data access and transparency\n   - Request audience composition reporting, frequency distribution, placement breakdowns, and a degree of access to raw logs/clean-room if possible.\n10. Diversify inventory\n   - Don\u2019t concentrate spend on a single platform; allocate a test budget to emerging teen platforms and programmatic PMPs so you can pivot.\n\nSample contract language snippets (templates to adapt)\n- Teen-share step-down: \u201cIf average monthly teen MAU (13\u201317) for the Publisher, as verified by [measurement vendor], declines by \u226510% vs Baseline (Jan\u2013Mar 2025 average), Advertiser\u2019s guaranteed CPM shall be reduced by 7% for the subsequent quarter; declines \u226520% trigger a 15% reduction. Publisher may instead issue pro-rata impression credits equal to the shortfall.\u201d\n- Verified teen impression shortfall: \u201cAdvertiser guarantees X verified teen impressions. If verified teen impressions delivered <90% of guaranteed during the campaign window, Publisher will provide pro-rata credit equal to (Guaranteed \u2212 Delivered) \u00d7 CPM or extend delivery until satisfied, at Advertiser\u2019s election.\u201d\n- Pilot to scale: \u201cInitial 3-month pilot at Performance Pricing (CPC $Y or CPA $Z). If pilot KPIs met (Reach, VTR, CPA \u2264 target), Parties will execute Year 1 IO under blended CPM = base CPM \u2212 15% with performance bonus structure.\u201d\n- Measurement and IVT: \u201cAll inventory is subject to third-party verification. Publisher credits Advertiser for impressions deemed IVT or below agreed viewability thresholds at the effective CPM rate.\u201d\n\nRisks & mitigations\n- Publishers may resist pure performance pricing for awareness buys: use hybrid models and pilots.\n- Performance metrics can be gamed\u2014require independent verification and clear definitions (e.g., what counts as a \u2018teen impression\u2019).\n- Attribution lag/attribution model disputes: pre-agree on attribution windows and model (last click, multi-touch, validated conversions).\n\nNegotiation levers beyond price\n- Exclusivity for specific creative types or placements.\n- Frequency caps and audience capping to protect reach.\n- Creative optimization support and A/B testing made part of the IO.\n- Make free-of-charge add-ons: bonus placements, optimized placements, and reporting dashboards.\n- Most-favored-nation clause for same-targeted deals with other advertisers (if appropriate).\n\nDecision summary\n- For 2026\u201328, do not accept long-term premium CPMs at today\u2019s rates unless you get strong guarantees, steep downside protection, and annual re-opener clauses tied to verified teen metrics.\n- Prefer hybrid deals: guaranteed (lower) CPM + performance-based spend, short initial commitment/pilot, robust measurement and credits for shortfalls.\n- Insist on transparent verification and clear step-down/credit language linked to teen-usage and engagement.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Draft exact IO/contract clause language tailored to a brand-awareness or direct-response brief.\n- Model a sample blended pricing structure (percent split, sample CPM/CPC/CPA numbers) based on expected KPIs.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.75, "judge1_explanation": "The model treats declining teen usage as a meaningful risk for 2026\u201328: it advises against locking in multi-year premium CPMs, repeatedly frames MAU/engagement declines as likely to reduce value, and recommends step-down/renegotiation mechanics tied to verified teen usage.

You should stress\u2011test that assumption.\n\nWhy flat engagement is unlikely\n- Platform churn: teens flip platforms every few years (examples: Vine \u2192 Instagram Stories \u2192 Snapchat \u2192 TikTok; spikes like BeReal faded quickly). A single dominant feed can erode or be disrupted.\n- Format & algorithm risk: changes to feed algorithms, discovery, or format popularity (short-video vs ephemeral vs private groups) materially change engagement.\n- Concentration risk: if most traffic/engagement comes from one platform (e.g., TikTok), platform policy, API access, or an app ban can crash engagement quickly.\n- Creator economy shifts: creators follow audiences; if creators migrate or get better monetization elsewhere, user engagement follows.\n- Regulatory & privacy changes: platform-level rules, Apple/Google privacy updates, ad targeting limits and potential national/security actions (e.g., past/ongoing scrutiny of TikTok) affect reach and measurement.\n- Attention competition & macro cycles: new viral apps, games, or even macroeconomic ad slowdowns change how much teens engage and what the business can monetize.\n- Cohort effects: each teen cohort has different preferences; what works for 15\u2011year\u2011olds today may not retain 13\u2011year\u2011olds in two years.\n\nHow to model more realistically\n- Do scenario analysis, not a single flat line. Suggested scenarios for engagement/monetization:\n  - Base case: small annual drift (\u00b10\u20135%/yr).\n  - Conservative case: steady decline 10\u201315%/yr or a one-time 20\u201340% shock from platform migration/policy change.\n  - Worst case: platform outage/ban or creator exodus \u2192 50%+ drop in months.\n  - Upside: product becomes cross-platform hit \u2192 10\u201330% growth.\n- Sensitivity knobs: % users from top platform, DAU/MAU, sessions per DAU, time per session, Revenue/User (RPU)/CPM. Recompute revenue under \u00b110/25/50% changes to these inputs.\n- Use cohort analysis to model retention (30/60/90 day retention curves) and project lifetime engagement instead of assuming flat MAU.\n\nWhat to ask the startup / what to validate\n- Channel concentration: % of traffic and signups coming from each platform.\n- Creator dependence: % content produced by external creators and terms that bind them.\n- KPIs & cohort data: DAU/MAU, session length, sessions/day, 30/60/90 retention, viral coefficient, LTV by cohort.\n- First\u2011party user capture: do they own email/phone/first-party identifiers or are they purely reliant on platform tokens/APIs?\n- Contracts & monetization: any direct distribution or content deals; ad demand diversity; CPM sensitivity.\n- Product defensibility: network effects, on\u2011platform community, cross\u2011platform portability, stickiness drivers.\n\nPractical mitigations to reduce risk\n- Multi\u2011platform strategy: avoid single-platform dependency; build distribution on at least two dominant channels.\n- Own the user: push to capture first\u2011party identifiers and build a native experience (app/newsletter/communities).\n- Diversify monetization: subscriptions, commerce, creator monetization, not just ad CPMs.\n- Fast experimentation & ops: rapid product experiments to follow teen preferences and measure leading indicators.\n- Creator incentives: contracts, revenue shares, tools to lock in creators.\n\nKPI triggers for investor vigilance\n- >50% traffic from one platform \u2192 high concentration risk.\n- 30/60/90 retention trending down >10% quarter-over-quarter.\n- RPU/CPM decline >15% in a quarter without product changes.\n- Monthly active minutes per DAU falling >10%/quarter.\n\nBottom line\nAssuming stable engagement through 2028 is optimistic unless they can show durable, diversified distribution, signed creator partnerships, and first\u2011party user ownership.

That makes long, rigid guarantees risky. Prefer shorter, renewable deals with performance triggers, diversification and upside-sharing.\n\nDetails you can use to make the decision\n\nWhy predictability is limited\n- Platform churn happens fast in teen cohorts. Teens adopt new apps quickly and abandon others just as fast (Vine\u2019s rapid collapse, Snapchat/TikTok/Instagram shifts).\n- Technology and features change consumption patterns (short-form video, AR, AI-driven content). A platform that leads today can lose because it fails to adapt.\n- Regulatory and safety policy changes (age gates, advertising rules, COPPA-like laws) can materially restrict teen reach or monetization.\n- Advertising and macro economics affect brand budgets and CPMs\u2014ad spend volatility can reduce creator income even if engagement remains.\nNet: directionally knowable (short-form + discovery-first content likely to stay important), but timing and platform winners are hard to predict.\n\nKey variables to watch (leading indicators)\n- Platform-level metrics for the teen demo: DAU/MAU, time spent, session frequency, app downloads and retention by age cohort.\n- Engagement trends for your talent: follower growth rate, weekly engagement rate, watch-through / completion rates, average view time.\n- Ad-monetization signals: CPM/CPC trends, creator payout changes, ad inventory changes.\n- Policy/regulatory changes: any new age restrictions, ad rules, or content moderation shifts.\n- Market signals: VC funding, layoffs/acquisitions at platforms, product roadmap announcements.\n- Cultural signals: fast emerging apps among teens (TikTok\u2019s rise was visible via rapid DAU growth + share of teen attention).\n\nScenario framing (for contracts/strategy)\n- Base case (most likely): gradual shifts\u2014some platform erosion, but creators can migrate and retain a substantial share. Branding and adaptability matter.\n- Upside: new/adjacent platform(s) expand reach; creators\u2019 value rises.\n- Downside: rapid teen migration away from a platform, or regulatory change that cuts teen visibility/revenue by 30\u201370% over months.\n- Black swan: platform shutdown or blocking in major markets\u2014massive immediate loss.\n\nPractical contract strategy (how to hedge risk)\n- Avoid long fixed guaranteed fees without reassessment. If you sign multi-year, price a risk premium into guaranteed fees.\n- Prefer 12\u201324 month initial terms with 12-month renewal options (company can extend/creator can renegotiate).\n- Include performance triggers:\n  - Review periods every 3\u20136 months.\n  - If core engagement (define metric: e.g., average weekly views or engagement rate across agreed platforms) falls more than X% (30% is a reasonable alarm; 50% is severe) vs baseline over two consecutive review periods \u2192 shift to revenue-share or reduce guarantee by Y%.\n- Limited exclusivity: restrict exclusivity by product category and by platform family (e.g., require approval for exclusive deals on entirely new platforms).\n- Migration clause: if primary platform becomes materially unusable or teen reach drops below defined threshold, parties must re-negotiate or shift scope to other platforms.\n- Escalators/bonuses: pay upside for overperformance (new follower milestones, campaign-specific KPIs) to preserve incentives.\n- Shorter guaranteed payment schedules + advances recouped against future variable compensation if engagement drops.\n- Non-performance termination: allow partial termination or conversion to short-term renewals if KPIs aren\u2019t met.\n- IP and content ownership: retain rights to content library so talent/brands can reuse or migrate content to new platforms/partners.\n- Audit and reporting rights: frequent transparent reporting (platform analytics + third-party measurement where possible).\n\nCommercial pricing approach\n- For long guarantees, charge a higher rate (risk premium).\n- Alternative: lower guaranteed fee + higher commission/rev-share and CPM/CPV bonuses. This aligns payout with audience performance.\n- Consider banded pricing: base guarantee for baseline traffic, incremental payment per incremental audience threshold.\n\nBusiness/portfolio strategies to reduce platform risk\n- Diversify platforms: don't be reliant on just one app or one audience demographic. Spread presence across 3\u20134 platform types.\n- Build owned channels: mailing lists, Discord, websites, SMS, fan clubs\u2014these are lower-risk direct channels.\n- Develop non-platform IP: merchandise, licensing, real-world appearances, podcasts, TV/film, books\u2014these income streams are platform-agnostic.\n- Train creators in transferable skills: livestreaming, music, podcasting, product development, public speaking.\n- Audience segmentation: grow international audiences\u2014different regions shift at different paces.\n- Data partnerships: subscribe to platform analytics services and ad-market trackers to get early warnings.\n\nMonitoring cadence and decision rules\n- Weekly: core engagement and follower growth for each creator across platforms.\n- Monthly: platform-level signals (downloads, DAU, ad-market metrics).\n- Quarterly: contract review against thresholds; decide renewals or renegotiations.\n- Event-driven: immediate review on major platform policy shifts, sudden drops in DAU, or app store removal.\n\nSample concrete thresholds (examples you can adapt)\n- If median weekly views across agreed platforms drop >30% vs prior quarter for two consecutive quarters \u2192 renegotiate guaranteed fee or switch to revenue share.\n- If CPMs fall >25% and materially change revenue expectations \u2192 re-open commercial terms.\n- If platform DAU for teen demo falls >40% in 3 months \u2192 trigger migration clause.\n\nRecommendation\n- For most teen creators today: avoid locking into long fixed-price contracts through 2028 unless compensated with a meaningful risk premium and protective clauses.

Once a platform reaches high penetration among teens it tends to plateau and often \u2014 though not always immediately \u2014 lose share as younger users migrate to newer apps. Overall time spent on social media rose for many years, but attention shifts between platforms rather than a steady, open-ended rise on any single incumbent.\n\nWhat that looks like in practice (examples)\n- Myspace \u2192 Facebook: Early 2000s Myspace grew quickly among teens, then lost them once Facebook offered a cleaner experience and stronger network effects for the next cohort. Myspace\u2019s teen base collapsed as users switched.\n- Facebook \u2192 Instagram/Snapchat: Facebook became ubiquitous among teens but then ceded \u201ccoolness\u201d and engagement to Instagram and Snapchat in the 2010s. Facebook\u2019s overall reach stayed large (older teens/young adults and parents), but teen usage and intensity declined.\n- Snapchat \u2192 TikTok: Snapchat dominated teen attention for a period, especially for ephemeral messaging and Stories-style content, then TikTok\u2019s short-video format and algorithmic feed drove another rapid migration.\n- YouTube (and messaging apps) is notable for remaining persistently high in reach: some platforms serve as durable anchors (video or messaging), while feed-based social apps cycle faster.\n\nWhy that pattern happens\n- S\u2011curve adoption: network effects drive rapid growth; saturation follows when most of the relevant peer group is on the app.\n- Cohort effects and \u201ccoolness\u201d: teens prefer platforms where their peers are \u2014 when parents/older siblings or the mass audience arrive, younger cohorts often move to a newer space.\n- Attention is limited: new platforms don\u2019t expand total teen attention indefinitely; they reallocate it. That causes plateau/decline in incumbents\u2019 usage metrics.\n- Feature/format shifts: innovations (short-form video, ephemeral messaging, algorithmic discovery) can trigger rapid reallocation.\n- External forces: platform policy changes, moderation problems, parental or regulatory pressure, or monetization shifts can accelerate decline.\n\nWhat \u201cplateau\u201d vs \u201cdecline\u201d means\n- Penetration plateau: a high, stable share of teens have accounts but may use them less frequently.\n- Engagement decline: daily active usage or time spent falls as teens shift attention.\n- Full decline: both penetration and time fall as the cohort abandons the platform entirely.\n\nHow to measure and monitor this\n- Penetration (% of teens with accounts)\n- Daily/weekly active user rates among teens\n- Average time spent per teen per day\n- Share of mind (what proportion pick a platform as their primary social app)\n- Cross\u2011platform overlap (how many platforms an average teen uses)\n\nImplications / short forecast\n- Expect any successful new platform to grow fast, plateau once it captures most of the relevant peer group, then either stabilize at high reach (but possibly lower intensity) or see declining teen share as newer entrants appear.\n- Overall social media use among teens has grown over the long term, but growth is uneven and often concentrated on new formats (e.g., short video).

National and platform trends are mixed, vary by age/group/platform, and change quickly; presenting \u201csocial media use is already declining\u201d as settled fact risks inaccuracy, complacency, or losing credibility with teens and parents.\n\nWhat to consider before using that claim\n- Data quality and recency: Only use the claim if you have current (within 1\u20132 years), reliable data for your target population (e.g., local school district, age band, country). National or global headlines can mask big subgroup differences.\n- Metric specificity: Are you referring to daily time spent, proportion of teens using a given app, frequency (\u201calmost constantly\u201d), or user numbers? Declines on one metric or platform do not imply declines across the board.\n- Variation by subgroup: Trends often differ by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and platform. A single headline can misrepresent these nuances.\n- Speed of change: Social platforms and behaviors shift rapidly; a decline this year could be followed by growth if a new app emerges.\n- Campaign goals: If your aim is to reduce harm, emphasize behaviors, coping skills, and structural fixes (privacy, moderation, screen-time design) rather than focusing solely on broad usage trends.\n\nRisks of emphasizing \u201cuse is declining\u201d\n- Complacency: Parents/decision\u2011makers might deprioritize prevention or support.\n- Loss of credibility: If local experience contradicts the claim, audiences may distrust other campaign content.\n- Minimizes ongoing harms: Even with less overall use, vulnerable teens may still experience harm (cyberbullying, addictive features, sleep disruption).\n\nHow to frame the message (recommended approaches)\n- Cautious/accurate framing: \u201cSome recent surveys show declines in use for certain age groups or apps, but trends vary and risks remain for many teens.\u201d\n- Focus on behavior and wellbeing: \u201cRegardless of overall trends, many teens still struggle with sleep, anxiety, or online harassment \u2014 here\u2019s how to help.\u201d\n- Use specific, sourced claims: If citing decline, name the source, population, metric, and time period: e.g., \u201cIn [survey/source, year], X% of 13\u201317\u2011year\u2011olds reported daily use of [platform], down from Y% in [prior year].\u201d\n- Emphasize ongoing action: \u201cEven as use changes, schools and families can support healthier habits and safer online spaces.\u201d\n\nPractical checklist before including the claim\n1. Verify data: recent, reputable source(s) for your target population.\n2. Be specific: metric, platform, age range, time period.\n3. Add caveats: note subgroup variation and uncertainty.\n4. Pair with action: tips, resources, supports for teens and parents.\n5. Pretest: run messages with teens/parents to check reactions and credibility.\n6.

Let strategy, evidence, risk, and measurable outcomes guide the decision \u2014 and if you\u2019re unsure, test the role with a lower-risk pilot before committing to a permanent hire.\n\nUse the following framework to decide.\n\n1) Start with mission and goals\n- What do you want social media to achieve for your teen mental-health work? (examples: drive teens to evidence-based resources, recruit program participants, provide crisis signposting, reduce stigma, increase donations, build partnerships)\n- If those outcomes are central to your strategy and can realistically be influenced by social media, having a dedicated person is more justifiable.\n\n2) Assess demand and evidence\n- Current metrics: audit existing channels (followers, impressions, engagement rates, referral traffic, DMs, conversion to services). Is there consistent growth or meaningful engagement?\n- Audience behavior: track where your target teens actually spend time (TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Discord). Platform fragmentation and private/ephemeral usage are real \u2014 presence matters even as platforms shift.\n- Needs analysis: are you missing opportunities (unanswered DMs, slow moderation, no campaigns, poor crisis response)?\n\n3) Calculate costs vs. benefits\n- Full-time costs: salary + benefits + tools/training. (Typical US coordinator ranges vary widely; adjust for your market.)\n- Alternatives: part-time employee, contractor/agency, freelancer, interns, or shared communications staff.\n- Estimate expected outputs (e.g., referrals per month, program signups, donations attributed) and compare to cost. Use conservative assumptions.\n\n4) Consider safety, liability, and operational complexity\n- Teen mental-health work requires moderation, crisis protocols, data/privacy safeguards, parental consent where applicable, and staff training.\n- A full-time hire is more likely to sustain safe moderation and rapid crisis response than an occasional contractor \u2014 that\u2019s a key value proposition beyond content creation.\n\n5) Risk tolerance and opportunity cost\n- What else could you fund with the same money?
