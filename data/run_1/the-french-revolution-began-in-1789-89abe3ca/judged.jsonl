Challenging the traditional 1789 start-date is a long-standing, legitimate historiographical move \u2014 but it can also be done poorly for attention. Use a checklist to distinguish careful scholarship from contrarianism.\n\nThings that point to serious scholarship\n- Engagement with the existing literature: the author cites major works on the French Revolution and explains how their argument differs from or builds on them (not just dismisses them).\n- Clear methodology: they explain whether they\u2019re working with event-focused periodization, structural/longue dur\u00e9e causes, social or cultural history, quantitative evidence, etc., and why that approach is appropriate.\n- Primary-source grounding: claims are backed by contemporary documents (official papers, correspondence, newspapers, parish records, etc.) or systematic use of data rather than just rhetorical flourishes.\n- Specific, testable claims: the argument makes falsifiable claims about timing, causation, or impact that could be debated with evidence, not vague proclamations (\u201cit didn\u2019t start in 1789\u201d with no follow-up).\n- Peer review / reputable venue: publication in a respected journal or with an academic press, or positive reviews in established outlets, increases credibility.\n- Nuanced tone: acknowledges counter-arguments and limits rather than polemical or sensational language.\n- Scholarly reputation / expertise: the author\u2019s track record, training, and research focus align with the topic (though non-specialists can offer useful perspectives if careful).\n\nRed flags for contrarian or low-quality work\n- Grandiose claims without evidence or without situating in historiography.\n- Reliance on rhetorical provocation (\u201crethink everything!\u201d) rather than sustained argumentation.\n- Publication-only on self-published blogs or vanity presses with no peer review (though be cautious \u2014 innovative work sometimes appears outside mainstream venues).\n- Lack of primary-source evidence or cherry-picking evidence to fit a thesis.\n- Tone that\u2019s polemical, gratuitously revisionist, or aimed at media attention rather than scholarly debate.\n- Failure to engage obvious counter-examples or established historiographical positions.\n\nHow to evaluate quickly\n- Read the article\u2019s abstract, introduction, and conclusion: do they lay out a clear argument and engage other historians?\n- Skim footnotes/bibliography: are primary sources and relevant secondary literature cited?\n- Check where it was published and whether it was peer-reviewed.\n- Look for reviews or responses in scholarly journals, if any.\n- Search the author\u2019s other work and institutional profile for relevant expertise.\n- Ask colleagues who specialize in the French Revolution for a quick read if possible.\n\nPractical steps for the conference decision\n- If you\u2019re unsure, invite the speaker but frame their talk within a panel or Q&A so their argument will be tested; this is often productive for audiences.\n- Request a paper or extended abstract in advance and assess it with the checklist above.\n- If you don\u2019t want controversy, prefer applicants whose work demonstrates clear methodological rigor and engagement.\n- If the conference aims to provoke historiographical debate, including someone with a revisionist thesis can be valuable \u2014 but balance the program with mainstream specialists to ensure quality debate.\n\nIf you want, paste the article\u2019s title/abstract or a paragraph and I\u2019ll give a quick read and assessment.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.7, "judge1_explanation": "The model treats 1789 as the traditional start-date and frames challenges to it as a legitimate historiographical position, while also allowing that such challenges can be poor or contrarian.

For academic, interpretive, or tightly argued work, a brief qualification is helpful because the \u201cstart\u201d depends on how you define \u201crevolution.\u201d\n\nWhy historians qualify it\n- Multiple plausible anchors: the Estates\u2011General (May 1789), the storming of the Bastille (14 July 1789), the August reforms/Declaration of the Rights of Man (Aug. 1789), or earlier fiscal/social crises.  \n- Different definitions: political regime change, social transformation, or cultural revolution each point to different beginnings.  \n- Long-term processes and regional variation mean there is rarely a single instant that fully captures the phenomenon.\n\nPractical guidance\n- If your audience is general or the date isn\u2019t central to your argument: say \u201c1789\u201d without extra caveats. It\u2019s the conventional, easily understood reference.  \n- If precision matters (scholarship, debate about causes/periodization, or you want to avoid teleology): add a short qualifier or footnote rather than an extended caveat.\n\nSuggested phrasings\n- Minimal: \u201cThe French Revolution began in 1789.\u201d  \n- Slightly qualified: \u201cThe French Revolution is commonly dated to 1789.\u201d  \n- More explicit: \u201cThe French Revolution is usually dated to 1789, though historians disagree about which events or processes mark its true beginning.\u201d  \n- Footnote: give one line explaining alternatives (e.g., fiscal crisis of the 1780s, Bastille, or 1792 republican turn).\n\nRecommendation: use the shortest phrasing that matches your audience and purpose.
