Clarify what they meant. If they were referring to a specific patient, ask how they determined that (inspection, palpation of PMI, chest x\u2011ray).\n2.

These are uncommon congenital variants (situs inversus totalis is roughly on the order of 1 in 10,000 people). In those cases the apex and PMI are on the right.\n\n- How clinicians confirm: PMI on palpation, auscultation, chest X\u2011ray, ECG and echocardiography will show the true position.\n\nFor your anatomy exam: memorize that the heart\u2019s apex is at the left 5th intercostal space at the mid\u2011clavicular line; the heart extends from about the 2nd to 5th intercostal spaces and is mainly left of the midline.

If body habitus or surgical scars obscure landmarks, place leads where you can best palpate the interspaces (and note deviations in your chart).\n\nPractical bedside tip:\n- For an exam: listen at the five spots (A, P, E, T, M).

Make a professional/artistic compromise if needed.\n   - If you feel the composition suffers, offer alternatives (slightly off-center, mirrored pair, or a central position) and explain how each looks.\n   - If you are uncomfortable doing it exactly as requested for artistic or personal reasons, you may decline the job \u2014 but do so professionally and ideally refer them elsewhere.\n\nSuggested wording to use with the client\n- \u201cI usually place heart tattoos here (point).

How to render the translation while waiting for an answer\n   - Option A (recommended for most professional/academic work): Translate literally and add a translator\u2019s note or query note pointing out the likely discrepancy and asking for confirmation.\n   - Option B (only with explicit editorial approval): Correct to \"left\" and mark the change as an editorial correction.\n   - Option C (for informal/internal drafts): Put the original word in brackets and add a footnote/query.\n\nSample translator\u2019s note (short)\n   Translator\u2019s note: The original text states \"the heart is located on the right side of the chest.\" The heart is normally on the left.

X)\n   Message: On page X the source text reads \"the heart is located on the right side of the chest.\" Normally the heart is on the left, so I want to confirm whether this refers to a specific case of dextrocardia/situs inversus or is a typo. How should I render this in the translation?\n\nQuick note on dextrocardia/situs inversus\n   - Dextrocardia is a rare congenital condition in which the heart is situated on the right; complete mirror-image situs inversus is uncommon (roughly on the order of 1 in 10,000 people).
