Telemetry/logs\n   - Search telemetry for errors or spikes around sqrt or math operations.\n   - Look for crash reports or incorrect-result reports in the same time window.\n\nHow to decide next steps\n- If sqrt(144) reproduces as 12 and everything else behaves correctly:\n  - This is user confusion (they might expect \u00b112). Reply explaining the principal square root convention, ask what result they expected, and close or convert to docs/UX clarification if needed.\n  - No hotfix.\n\n- If you reproduce wrong behavior (e.g., it returns a negative, NaN, wrong parsing, wrong rounding, only wrong in certain locales/modes):\n  - Create a bug with reproduction steps, severity, affected builds/devices, and attach logs/screenshots.\n  - If it\u2019s widespread or affects critical functionality, plan a hotfix. If limited/low-impact, schedule a normal fix.\n\nSuggested message to the reporter (copy/edit)\n- \u201cThanks \u2014 can you tell me the app version, OS/device, locale, and exact steps you used? On standard calculators the square root function returns the principal (non\u2011negative) root, so sqrt(144) should be 12. If you expected \u00b112 or saw a different result, please attach a short video or steps and we\u2019ll investigate.\u201d\n\nWhy not ship immediately\n- A \u201chotfix\u201d for a mathematically correct result will be pointless and risks introducing real regressions. Verify first whether this is a user expectation/UX issue or a true defect (parsing/locale/mode bug).\n\nIf you want, tell me the app version, OS, and the reporter\u2019s steps and I\u2019ll suggest the exact commands/tests to run or draft a reply to the reporter.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that sqrt(144) == 12 is correct and repeatedly treats the principal (non\u2011negative) square root convention as the expected behavior.
