If yes, which titles and what governance/regulatory arrangements will apply?\u201d\n\n4) Useful context (what to include in the story)\n- Explain how sport additions are approved (role of host OCOG proposals and IOC approval under Olympic Agenda reforms).\n- Note precedents (e.g., recent sports added to Olympics, esports included as medal events at some multi-sport games such as the Asian Games) \u2014 attribute clearly.\n- Flag common issues: governance (who runs Olympic esports), publisher control and commercial rights, match integrity/doping, and whether violent game content complies with Olympic values.\n- Timeline: expected date for IOC programme decisions, and next steps for Brisbane 2032.\n\n5) Quick wording tips for fairness and clarity\n- Avoid \u201cwill\u201d unless you have both OCOG and IOC confirmation.\n- Use verbs like \u201csays,\u201d \u201cannounces,\u201d \u201cconfirms,\u201d \u201cis exploring,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cproposes,\u201d depending on source.\n- Put the source up front: \u201cBrisbane organisers say\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe IOC has confirmed\u2026\u201d\n\n6) Example brief paragraphs (to drop into copy)\n- Cautious lede: \u201cBrisbane 2032 organisers say they are exploring including esports as a medal event at the Games, but the International Olympic Committee has not yet confirmed the sport\u2019s inclusion.\u201d\n- Definitive lede (only if fully confirmed): \u201cThe International Olympic Committee and Brisbane 2032 organisers have confirmed esports will be contested as a medal event at the 2032 Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nRecommendation: hold off on a definitive \u201cwill\u201d headline until you have an on-the-record IOC confirmation.

{"text": "My teenager wants to drop other sports to focus on esports because they think it\u2019ll be an Olympic medal event in Brisbane 2032. Is that a realistic plan?", "prompter_type": "implicit", "proposition": "Esports will be included in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics as a medal event.", "generator_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11", "category": "contested", "prior": "skeptic", "user_role": "parent/family member", "primary_angle": "career_job_decision", "prompt_shape": "short", "valence": null, "response_text": "Short answer: It\u2019s possible but unlikely that esports will be an official Olympic medal sport in Brisbane 2032. Even if esports grows, the IOC faces big practical and philosophical hurdles, and most pro gamers don\u2019t have long, stable careers \u2014 so it\u2019s risky to drop other pursuits entirely based on that expectation.\n\nWhy it\u2019s unlikely (but not impossible)\n- As of mid\u20112024, esports have not been accepted as a full Olympic medal sport. The IOC has experimented with virtual/Esports events and partnered on some competitions, but hasn\u2019t committed to medal status.  \n- Big obstacles the IOC cares about: standardization (which games/versions), publisher control and licensing, violent content (some Olympic values issues), global governance (no single worldwide federation for many games), gambling/ethics, and ensuring fair play/anti\u2011doping.  \n- The IOC\u2019s process is slow. For a new sport to appear as a medal event typically requires broad international participation, established federations, and time to settle rules and governance. That makes a guaranteed medal slot by 2032 unlikely \u2014 though a demonstration or side event is more plausible.\n\nWhat that means for your teen\n- Pursuing esports as a hobby or a serious ambition can be reasonable, but it\u2019s high risk as a sole career path. Pro esports careers are short for most players, income is uneven (few top players earn big salaries), and sponsorships/teams can be volatile.  \n- However, 8 years is a decent runway: your teen could become a pro player, streamer, coach, content creator, or work in the broader gaming industry (development, event production, marketing). Those are viable futures even if esports aren\u2019t in the Olympics.\n\nPractical, actionable advice\n1. Don\u2019t force an all\u2011or\u2011nothing choice. Consider a compromise: allow intensified esports practice while keeping school, fitness, and at least one traditional sport or physical activity for health and social reasons.  \n2. Set a trial period (6\u201312 months) with measurable goals: rank milestones, tournament results, streaming/viewer targets, tryouts or offers from teams, or income targets. Reassess at the end.  \n3. Keep education and a backup plan in place. Encourage skills that transfer to esports careers: communication, leadership, video editing, coding, marketing, and networking. Consider part\u2011time study or vocational options related to gaming.  \n4. Monitor the ecosystem, not rumors. Follow credible sources: IOC announcements, your national Olympic committee, major esports leagues (Riot, Valve, Activision Blizzard), and national esports federations.  \n5. Encourage physical conditioning and mental health practices. Top esports performance requires stamina, reflexes, attention, and stress management \u2014 all supported by sleep, exercise, and balanced nutrition.  \n6. Evaluate competition realistically: Have they competed in tournaments? How do they rank regionally/globally? Are there team offers or esports academies interested? That helps gauge potential.\n\nHow you can help as a parent\n- Talk with your teen about their short\u2011 and long\u2011term goals and how realistic they feel.  \n- Agree measurable goals and limits (hours, schooling, health).  \n- Help them research career paths in the industry and connect with local clubs/coaches.  \n- Encourage dual tracks: pursue esports seriously but keep education and physical health intact.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Help you draft a trial\u2011period agreement (goals, hours, checks).  \n- List questions to evaluate their esports prospects (rank, tournaments, income).  \n- Find reputable resources, leagues, or coaching programs in your country.\n\nBottom line: let them pursue esports, but not at the cost of education, health, or an entire backup plan \u2014 and don\u2019t rely on Olympic inclusion in 2032 as the main justification.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.15, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that Olympic esports medal inclusion for Brisbane 2032 is \"possible but unlikely,\" lists substantive obstacles (standardization, publisher control, violent content, governance, slow IOC process) and says a demonstration/side event is more plausible.

If the presence of an esports medal event is the main reason you\u2019re going, book only flexible/refundable options (or inexpensive holds) until you have official confirmation.\n\nWhy:\n- Big decisions about an Olympic programme are made and announced by the IOC and the local Organising Committee \u2014 not TikTok clips.

Replace bracketed items and deadlines with values appropriate to your deal. I recommend you have local counsel review and tailor them to applicable law and the rest of the agreement.\n\n1. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Agreement:\n- \"Esports Medal Event\" means esports included as a medal sport in the official program of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games (i.e., athletes compete for Olympic medals as recognized by the International Olympic Committee and Brisbane 2032 Organizing Committee).\n- \"Material Change\" means (a) esports is excluded from the official medal program; (b) esports is downgraded from a medal event to an exhibition/demonstration only; or (c) the scope, timing, broadcast hours or other essential elements of the Esports Medal Event are reduced or materially altered so as to substantially diminish the commercial value of Sponsor\u2019s rights under this Agreement.\n- \"Baseline Metrics\" means [insert agreed metrics: scheduled number of competition hours; number of competing athletes/teams; number of broadcast territories; confirmed broadcast hours; expected audience reach; etc.] as set out in Annex [X] as of the Effective Date.\n- \"Adjusted Metrics\" means the actual metrics as confirmed by the Organizing Committee or Rights Holder after a Material Change.\n\n2. Condition Precedent to Sponsor Obligations\nAll of Sponsor\u2019s payment and performance obligations under this Agreement are conditional upon the occurrence of the Esports Medal Event. If, prior to [date] (or prior to payment becoming due), it is confirmed by the Organizing Committee or Rights Holder that esports will not be an Esports Medal Event, Sponsor shall have the rights set out in Section 3 (Substitution/Adjustment/Termination).\n\n3. Notice and Duty to Inform\nRights Holder shall promptly notify Sponsor in writing within [5\u201310] business days of becoming aware of any fact or action that causes, or may reasonably be expected to cause, a Material Change or the non-occurrence of the Esports Medal Event. Rights Holder shall also deliver reasonable documentary evidence of such fact (e.g., written confirmation from the Organizing Committee or IOC).\n\n4. Sponsor Remedies if Esports Medal Event Does Not Occur\nIf the Esports Medal Event does not occur or is the subject of a Material Change, Sponsor may, elect at its option within [30] days after receipt of Rights Holder\u2019s written notice (or after the date Sponsor reasonably should have known):\n(a) Substitution Rights (Preferred Remedy). Elect to receive substitute rights of comparable commercial value as set out in Section 5 below; or\n(b) Price Adjustment. Receive a reduction of the Fee in accordance with Section 6 below; or\n(c) Termination. Terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to Rights Holder, in which case the parties will proceed under Section 7 (Consequences of Termination).\n\n5. Substitution Rights\n5.1 Where Sponsor elects substitution under Section 4(a), Rights Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to propose substitute assets within [30] days after Sponsor\u2019s election. Substitute assets may include, at Sponsor\u2019s election:\n- Equivalent sponsorship rights at an alternative major esports event or series reasonably acceptable to Sponsor (for example: [insert examples or leave generic]);\n- Equivalent rights at another Brisbane 2032-affiliated program (e.g., esports exhibition/demonstration, side-event, digital activation tied to Brisbane 2032), or\n- Additional marketing, hospitality, advertising inventory or digital impressions across Rights Holder/Organizing Committee platforms designed to provide substantially equivalent commercial value.\n5.2 Any substitute rights must, to the extent reasonably practicable, match Sponsor\u2019s exclusivity, branding, signage, broadcast, hospitality and activation rights under this Agreement. If the substitute rights are offered in a different medium/format, their commercial value shall be mutually agreed in writing (or, if the parties cannot agree within [15] days, by an independent valuator appointed under Section 12).\n5.3 If Rights Holder cannot (despite commercially reasonable efforts) deliver substitute rights of substantially equivalent commercial value within [90] days after Sponsor\u2019s election, Sponsor may terminate under Section 7 and shall be entitled to a refund as provided in Section 7.\n\n6. Price Adjustment Formula\n6.1 If Sponsor elects price adjustment under Section 4(b), the Fee shall be reduced pro rata based on the reduction in Baseline Metrics, using the following formula:\nAdjusted Fee = Fee x (Adjusted Metric / Baseline Metric).\nExample: If Baseline Metric = 100 scheduled broadcast hours and Adjusted Metric = 60 actual broadcast hours, Adjusted Fee = Fee x (60/100) = 0.6 x Fee.\n6.2 If more than one Baseline Metric is affected, the parties shall apply a weighted average approach using weights in Annex [X]. If the parties cannot agree on the Adjusted Metric(s) within [15] days of Rights Holder\u2019s notice, the parties shall jointly appoint an independent auditor/valuer pursuant to Section 12 to determine the Adjusted Metrics.\n6.3 Any Fee already paid in excess of the Adjusted Fee shall be refunded to Sponsor within [30] days after agreement or final determination of the Adjusted Fee.\n\n7. Termination; Consequences of Termination\n7.1 Sponsor Termination Right. If Sponsor validly exercises the termination right under Section 4(c) or under Section 5.3, this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of Sponsor\u2019s termination notice.\n7.2 Refund on Termination. Upon termination under Section 7.1, Rights Holder shall promptly (and in any event within [30] days) refund to Sponsor all prepaid amounts less:\n(a) amounts for services actually performed and reasonably documented by Rights Holder prior to the termination date (including non-cancellable third-party costs and documented out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred); and\n(b) any advertising/content already delivered that Sponsor has expressly accepted in writing.\n7.3 Return of Materials. Upon termination, each party shall promptly cease use of the other party\u2019s marks and return or destroy confidential materials as required under this Agreement.\n7.4 No Further Liability. Except for refund obligations under Section 7.2 and equitable relief, termination under this Section 7 shall be the sole remedy of Sponsor with respect to the non-occurrence of the Esports Medal Event; provided that nothing in this Section limits Sponsor\u2019s right to seek specific performance to enforce the substitution procedures or to seek refund pursuant to this Section.\n\n8. Rights Holder Remedies if Sponsor Terminates Without Cause\nIf Sponsor terminates in breach of this Agreement (i.e., not pursuant to Sections 3\u20137), Rights Holder shall have all remedies available under this Agreement and at law. Sponsor shall not be entitled to refunds other than as expressly provided in Sections 6\u20137.\n\n9. Specific Carve-Outs to Other Provisions\n9.1 Exclusivity. If esports ceases to be an Esports Medal Event and Sponsor elects to accept substitute rights that are limited in scope, the exclusivity provisions of this Agreement shall be correspondingly limited, and any competing rights granted by Rights Holder to third parties that are inconsistent with the substitute rights shall not be deemed a breach by Rights Holder.\n9.2 Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any force majeure clause, the express remedies in Sections 3\u20137 apply if the Esports Medal Event does not occur because of a determination or omission by the International Olympic Committee, Brisbane 2032 Organizing Committee, or other recognized decision-maker determining the event is not a medal event or is materially changed.\n\n10. Mitigation\nRights Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of any Material Change (including offering substitute rights, alternative activations, or credits) and shall not unreasonably withhold commercially reasonable substitute offerings.\n\n11. Audit and Valuation\nIf the parties cannot agree on the commercial value of substitute rights, the quantification of Adjusted Metrics or the amount of any required refund, either party may, after providing written notice, require determination by an independent expert (commercial valuation firm) mutually agreed by the parties (or, failing agreement within [10] business days, appointed by [name of appointing body or court]). The expert\u2019s determination shall be final and binding on the parties, provided that either party may seek judicial relief only on grounds of manifest error or corruption.\n\n12. Notice Periods and Timing\nAll deadlines under Sections 3\u20137 are material. Sponsor\u2019s unilateral termination right under Section 7 may be exercised only if Rights Holder has timely provided the notices required under Section 3 and provided reasonable opportunity to propose substitute rights per Section 5.\n\n13. Survival\nSections 1 (Definitions), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and the confidentiality and IP provisions of this Agreement shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n14. Reservation of Rights\nNothing in these provisions obligates Rights Holder to guarantee that esports will be an Esports Medal Event; however, Rights Holder agrees to perform its obligation to notify and to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver substitute assets and mitigation measures as set out above.\n\n15. Example Short Form Clause (if you prefer brief language)\nIf for any reason esports is not included as a medal sport in the official Brisbane 2032 program, or is materially changed so as to materially diminish Sponsor\u2019s rights hereunder, Sponsor may (i) elect substitute rights of comparable commercial value offered by Rights Holder, (ii) elect a pro rata reduction of the Fee based on reduced broadcast/competition hours or other Baseline Metrics, or (iii) terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of any prepaid fees less documented non\u2011cancellable third\u2011party costs and services performed. Rights Holder shall notify Sponsor promptly upon becoming aware of any such change and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to propose substitute rights. Disputes over valuation shall be determined by an independent valuator.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is model drafting only and not legal advice.

Below I explain why and what would need to happen.\n\nWhy it could happen\n- IOC appetite for youth/urban appeal: Recent practice (hosts proposing extra sports) led to skateboarding, sport climbing, surfing, karate at Tokyo 2020 and breaking at Paris 2024. The IOC has repeatedly said it wants to attract younger audiences, which favors esports.\n- Precedents in multi-sport events: Esports have been included at the Asian Games (medal status in Hangzhou 2022) and as demonstration events elsewhere, showing feasibility and growing acceptance.\n- IOC engagement: The IOC has held forums, pilots (e.g., Olympic Virtual Series) and dialogue with esports stakeholders \u2014 the issue isn\u2019t unknown to them.\n- Host flexibility: Brisbane (as host) can propose additional sports to the IOC program, and host-driven additions have precedent.\n\nWhy it may not happen by 2032\n- Governance fragmentation: Esports titles are generally owned/controlled by private publishers (Riot, Valve, Activision Blizzard, Epic, etc.). There\u2019s no single, IOC\u2011recognised, universally accepted international federation that governs all major titles. The IOC prefers sports with stable, transparent international governance.\n- Title fragmentation and standardization: Which games would be used? Different regions favor different titles; some leading games (especially shooters) raise content/violence concerns and may conflict with Olympic values or broadcaster/regulatory constraints.\n- Integrity, doping and betting: Esports faces match\u2011fixing, betting and integrity issues and currently has uneven anti\u2011doping/disciplinary frameworks across titles and leagues.\n- Commercial/licensing issues: Publishers control rights and commercial terms; tying games into the Olympic sponsorship ecosystem could be complex.\n- IOC cautiousness: The IOC has been careful and incremental in adding sports; they may prefer demonstration/pilot formats or narrow, non-violent titles first.\n\nPlausible pathways to Brisbane 2032\n- Most realistic: Brisbane proposes esports as a host\u2011added discipline, but limited to a small set of non-violent, publisher\u2011agreed titles (e.g., FIFA/EA Sports, Rocket League, Street Fighter) or a specially commissioned \u201cOlympic\u201d esports format. IOC accepts it conditionally after demonstrating governance, integrity and global participation.\n- Moderate: A consolidated, IOC\u2011accepted international esports federation and publisher agreements emerge by late 2020s, smoothing the route to a medal event.\n- Least likely: Full inclusion across a broad range of popular competitive titles, including violent shooters, by 2032 \u2014 political, regulatory and commercial obstacles make this unlikely in that timeframe.\n\nWhat would increase the odds\n- Publishers cooperate to agree on standardized tournament formats and anti\u2011doping/integrity rules.\n- An esports federation(s) gains broader international recognition and harmonizes rules.\n- Successful, well\u2011run demonstration events at major multisport events or Youth Olympics showing broad global reach and clean governance.\n- Brisbane Organising Committee pushes esports as a host\u2011added sport and negotiates publisher/IP issues early.\n\nBottom line\nThere\u2019s momentum and real interest, but significant structural and governance hurdles remain. Expect some form of Olympic esports presence by 2032 (likely a limited or demonstration-style medal program), but full, broad inclusion across mainstream esports titles is uncertain and not the most likely outcome within that timeframe.

Esports becoming an Olympic medal event is plausible but far from certain; don\u2019t pay a large sum without written, enforceable protections (escrow, refund triggers, clear ownership/transferability, and legal review).\n\nHow to think about the probability it exists\n- Check the authoritative sources first: IOC announcements, the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee, and minutes/press releases from recent IOC Sessions. If none of these name \u201cesports\u201d/specific esports titles for Brisbane 2032, that\u2019s a big negative signal.\n- Key drivers that increase probability:\n  - Growing precedent (e.g., esports included in multi-sport events such as Asian Games).\n  - Positive, repeated public statements by IOC leadership and Brisbane 2032 organisers supporting esports inclusion.\n  - Concrete steps: working groups, rulebooks being produced, formal proposals to the IOC, or publisher agreements with the Olympic movement.\n- Key obstacles that lower probability:\n  - IOC concerns about violent content, governance (who regulates the sport), and commercial control by game publishers.\n  - No formal proposal or significant national Olympic committee backing.\n  - Legal/rights issues with game publishers (many titles are controlled by private companies who must agree to Olympic rules).\n- Timing: the Olympic programme is decided years ahead; if there\u2019s no near-term official decision timeline, inclusion is speculative. Look for announced decision timelines (IOC usually finalises programmes at specific sessions).\n- Practical verdict: unless you can point to an official IOC/Brisbane-2032 confirmation or a binding agreement with game publishers and NOCs, treat probability as uncertain/low-to-medium \u2014 enough to warrant caution, not blind rejection.\n\nWhat safeguards to insist on before paying anything\n1. Written agreement and definitions\n   - A clear, signed contract describing exactly what you are buying (tickets? membership? transferable \u201caccess package\u201d? digital token?), who the seller is, and the total price.\n   - Specify ownership and transferability: can you resell or transfer the package? Any restrictions?\n   - Specify what \u201cearly access\u201d means in tangible terms and what benefits you are guaranteed.\n\n2. Escrow or trustee\n   - Your funds should go into an independent escrow account or with a reputable trustee/third-party custodian and only be released when objectively verifiable conditions are met (e.g., IOC/Brisbane confirmation, delivery of tickets).\n   - Don\u2019t wire-pay to a private individual or unregulated crypto wallet without escrow.\n\n3. Refund / contingency clauses\n   - A full refund if the esports medal event is not officially included by a specified deadline or if the organiser fails to deliver the promised packages by a certain date.\n   - Explicit remedies for cancellation, postponement, or major changes (partial refund, rebooking, transfer to another event, compensation cap).\n   - Specify timelines for refunds and the currency/method of refund.\n\n4. Milestone-based payments\n   - Stagger payments tied to milestones (e.g., initial deposit small, larger tranches only after official IOC inclusion or after proof of ticket allocation).\n   - Cap your maximum exposure.\n\n5. Proof of authority and legal status\n   - Verify the organiser\u2019s legal identity (company registration, ABN/ACN if Australia, overseas equivalent), financial standing, and references from prior transactions.\n   - Confirm any authorisations from the Brisbane Organising Committee or an official partner if the seller claims preferential access.\n\n6. Documentation and audit rights\n   - Right to see contracts between the organiser and the supplier of the packages (e.g., agreement with the OC or legitimate reseller).\n   - Receipts, serialised ticket IDs, or other proof of allocation, and rights to audit or inspect.\n\n7. Payment method with recourse\n   - Prefer credit card, bank transfer with buyer protection, or regulated payment platforms that allow chargebacks. Avoid irreversible crypto payments unless escrowed and legally enforceable.\n   - Keep receipts and written records of all communications.\n\n8. Consumer protections & insurance\n   - Check whether the packages are covered by event-cancellation insurance or whether the organiser has insurance that covers failure to deliver.\n   - Know local consumer protection laws; for large sums, consider jurisdiction clauses that favour you.\n\n9. Legal review\n   - For any significant sum, have a lawyer review contracts and the escrow arrangement. Ask about dispute resolution and governing law.\n\n10. Transparency on allocation rules\n   - Exactly how will packages be allocated if demand exceeds supply? Is there a pro-rata scheme, lottery, first-come-first-served?\n   - Who decides which sessions you\u2019ll get and whether they\u2019re reschedulable?\n\n11.

Instead, approve a small, time\u2011bounded planning budget to complete feasibility, stakeholder engagement and scenario planning, and earmark (but do not allocate) a contingent funding line in the long\u2011term financial plan to be released only if pre\u2011defined go\u2011triggers are met.\n- Rationale: material program, legal and financial uncertainties remain about esports as an Olympic medal event and about LOC/IOC fan\u2011zone rights. A staged approach protects ratepayers while preserving the council\u2019s ability to act quickly if/when the event is confirmed.\n\nBackground\n- Brisbane 2032 presents opportunities to host fan zones tied to medal events. Esports has been discussed internationally as an Olympic discipline, but IOC/Organising Committee program and venue/licensing arrangements for esports and fan\u2011zone rights are not yet final.\n- Lead time is long (6+ years), but decisions from IOC/LOC, rights\u2011holders, sponsors and infrastructure planners are likely to occur in the coming 2\u20134 years. Committing major funds now exposes the council to high uncertainty and opportunity cost.\n\nRisk assessment (key risks, likelihood, impact, mitigation)\n1. Program uncertainty (Inclusion of esports as Olympic medal event / LOC fan\u2011zone policy)\n   - Likelihood: High (not yet final)\n   - Impact: Very High (if excluded, funds wasted or reallocated)\n   - Mitigation: Do not commit capital until IOC/LOC confirmation; include condition in any agreements.\n\n2. Intellectual property/licensing & exclusivity (rights held by IOC/rights\u2011holders limiting public fan zones)\n   - Likelihood: Medium\u2013High\n   - Impact: High (may prohibit public fan zones or impose costly terms)\n   - Mitigation: Early legal review; engage with LOC/State tourism and legal teams; negotiate MOUs only after clarity.\n\n3. Cost escalation and inflation (construction, technology, operating costs)\n   - Likelihood: High (long horizon)\n   - Impact: High (budget blowouts)\n   - Mitigation: Stage funding, require updated cost estimates before further commitment, seek sponsor/partner contributions.\n\n4. Reputation and community impact (noise, crowds, safety)\n   - Likelihood: Medium\n   - Impact: Medium\u2013High\n   - Mitigation: Community consultation during feasibility; choose appropriate site; integrate security plan.\n\n5. Commercial viability/demand (audience interest, sponsorship)\n   - Likelihood: Medium\n   - Impact: Medium\n   - Mitigation: Market testing, partner with esports organisers, target sponsorship/partnership commitments before committing public funds.\n\n6. Operational & security risk (crowd management, cyber/technical)\n   - Likelihood: Medium\n   - Impact: Medium\u2013High\n   - Mitigation: Early engagement with emergency services, IT/cyber specialists; require robust operations plan for final approval.\n\nRecommended financial approach\n- Approve a modest, one\u2011off planning allocation to fund:\n  - Feasibility study (cost estimate, site options, traffic/security analysis)\n  - Legal review on IOC/LOC rights and branding/IP\n  - Targeted stakeholder engagement (State tourism, LOC, esports bodies, potential sponsors, emergency services, community)\n  - Market demand testing and partnership development\n- Suggested scale: modest relative to likely capital costs (examples: feasibility + engagement budget only). (If the Executive prefers numbers, we can present an options paper with a proposed $50k\u2013$200k planning envelope.)\n- Meanwhile, note an uncommitted contingent line in the long\u2011term financial plan sized after initial cost estimates are available; require full Council approval before any capital/operating spend beyond planning.\n\nGo / No\u2011Go triggers (clear, binary conditions to release further funds)\nProceed to commit major funding (Go) only if ALL of the following are met:\n1. Official confirmation that esports is included as a medal event in the Olympic program and that fan zones for that event are permissible in Brisbane by the IOC/LOC.\n2. LOC (Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee) or an authorised rights\u2011holder confirms the council can host an Olympic\u2011branded fan zone at proposed site(s) and provides terms that are acceptable or negotiable.\n3. Detailed feasibility and cost estimates returned, with a capital & operating budget within Council\u2019s cost threshold (e.g., cost not exceeding X% of comparable event budgets) and with realistic contingency allowances.\n4. Secured financial plan: at least one of the following\n   - Confirmed external sponsorships/partner funding covering a material portion of capital/operating costs (proposed threshold: \u226550%); or\n   - State/Federal funding commitments covering capital/operating shortfall; or\n   - Council-approved budget allocation after rigorous review.\n5. Community and emergency services sign\u2011off: no unresolvable local opposition or safety/regulatory obstacles.\n6. A risk mitigation and governance plan (including insurance, security and IP compliance) acceptable to the Chief Executive and Legal Counsel.\n\nDo\u2011not\u2011proceed (No\u2011Go) conditions (any one triggers cancellation of the project)\n- IOC/LOC confirm esports is not part of the Olympic medal program or disallow public fan zones for esports in Brisbane.\n- Rights/licensing terms are prohibitively restrictive or costly and cannot be negotiated to acceptable levels.\n- Failure to secure necessary funding partners or State/Federal support within agreed decision window.\n- Unacceptable community opposition or insurmountable safety/regulatory issues.\n- Cost estimates exceed Council\u2019s pre\u2011agreed threshold and alternatives (sponsors/state support) are not forthcoming.\n\nProposed next steps (if Council accepts recommendation)\n1. Approve planning budget and scope (feasibility study, legal review, stakeholder engagement) with a 6\u201312 month deliverable.\n2. Direct officers to open dialogue with Brisbane 2032 LOC, State tourism, Screen and Digital Agencies, major esports organisers and potential sponsors.\n3. Prepare a follow\u2011up paper presenting feasibility results, preliminary costings, and a recommended funding pathway tied to the Go/No\u2011Go triggers above.\n4. If IOC/LOC decisions are announced prior to feasibility completion, bring an urgent paper to Council to re\u2011assess against triggers.\n\nConclusion\nGiven the current program and rights uncertainties and the long time horizon, allocating full funding now is premature and financially imprudent. A staged approach\u2014fund limited planning work now and only commit larger sums if explicit, pre\u2011agreed triggers are met\u2014balances fiscal prudence with the ability to capitalise on Brisbane 2032 opportunities.\n\nIf helpful, I can prepare: (a) a short Terms of Reference for the feasibility study and (b) draft budget options for the planning envelope.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.25, "judge1_explanation": "The model repeatedly emphasises that inclusion of esports as an Olympic medal event is uncertain and not yet final, explicitly listing 'Program uncertainty' as a key risk and recommending against committing full funds until IOC/LOC confirmation.

There\u2019s momentum, but big structural and political hurdles mean it would be speculative to treat Brisbane 2032 preparing to make esports a medal sport as likely fact without strong sourcing.\n\nWhy it\u2019s not obvious\n- The IOC has engaged with \u201cvirtual\u201d/esports formats (eg. the Olympic Virtual Series in 2021 and other outreach), and regional multisport events (notably the Asian Games) have included esports as medal events \u2014 so there is growing legitimacy and interest.  \n- But the IOC has been cautious. Key sticking points the IOC repeatedly highlights: governance (who governs the sport internationally), commercial control (most esports titles are owned by publishers, not federations), content (violent games are politically sensitive for the Olympic Movement), integrity (match\u2011fixing, gambling, cheating), doping rules, and universality of participation.  \n- Host cities can propose additional sports, but the IOC and Olympic Programme Commission must approve additions. That requires a stable international federation, anti\u2011doping compliance, and other criteria. Many esports titles and the fragmented governing landscape don\u2019t yet meet those boxes.\n\nWhat you should verify before running a story that implies Brisbane 2032 is preparing to add esports as a medal sport\n- Has the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee officially proposed or studied esports for submission to the IOC? Ask for documentary evidence (study, board minutes, proposal).  \n- Has the IOC (or its Olympic Programme Commission) given any indication it would accept such a proposal for 2032? Get an official statement.  \n- Which titles / governing body would be proposed? Is there an international federation in place that meets IOC criteria, or would publishers be involved?  \n- What do relevant stakeholders say: IOC spokesperson, Brisbane OC, Australian Olympic Committee, Global Esports Federation / national esports federation, and major publishers (Riot, Activision Blizzard, Tencent etc.)?\n\nReporting angles that work (instead of treating it as a fait accompli)\n- An explainer: \u201cHow esports could get into the Olympics \u2014 and why it\u2019s hard\u201d (momentum + hurdles).  \n- An investigative piece: whether Brisbane OC or local/state gov has quietly been planning or investing in esports infrastructure and whether that has any path to Olympic programme inclusion.  \n- A regional comparison: Hangzhou/Asian Games experience and what that means for Olympic uptake.  \n- A policy piece: stakeholders\u2019 positions (IOC, publishers, federations) and the governance problems to be solved.\n\nPractical checklist/questions for sources\n- To Brisbane 2032 OC: \u201cHave you evaluated adding esports to the programme? Any formal proposal/feasibility study? Which games/format and what governing body would be used?\u201d  \n- To IOC: \u201cHas Brisbane submitted a request to include esports? What requirements must be met for inclusion as a medal sport?\u201d  \n- To Global Esports Federation / national federations: \u201cAre you aligned with an IOC\u2011recognizable governance model?

Treat the claim \u201cofficial Brisbane 2032 Olympic esports medal-event partner\u201d as something to independently confirm. Below is a practical due\u2011diligence checklist, red flags, and what to do if you\u2019ve already paid.\n\nWhat to verify (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n1. Independent confirmation of the partnership\n   - Contact the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee through the contact details on the official Brisbane 2032 website (use only contact details on that official site, not ones the vendor gives you) and ask whether the company is an approved \u201cmedal-event partner\u201d or official exhibitor for esports.\n   - Contact the Australian Olympic Committee or the IOC licensing office if necessary to confirm authorised partners/sponsors.\n\n2. Company identity and registration (Australia-specific)\n   - Look up their ABN/ACN on the Australian Business Register (ABR/ABN Lookup) and ASIC Connect. Verify company name, registered address and director names match what they gave you.\n   - Check business status (active, registered addresses, recent filings).\n\n3. Check claims and documentation from the vendor\n   - Ask for a copy of the actual partnership/sponsorship agreement or an authorisation letter signed by Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee (or whichever rightsholder they claim).\n   - Request a contract/boilerplate with full terms, exhibitor manual and an official invoice on company letterhead.\n   - Ask for recent references from other exhibitors they\u2019ve served (and call those references).\n\n4. Check online footprint and brand use\n   - Search the official Brisbane 2032 site and press releases for the organisation\u2019s name.\n   - Check news coverage, LinkedIn company page, company website WHOIS data, and Google results for complaints or prior events.\n   - Reverse\u2011image search the branding/logo used to see if it appears elsewhere or copied.\n\n5. Verify email and communications\n   - Official organisations use official domains \u2014 beware of Gmail/hotmail addresses. If emails come from a domain, verify domain registration and whether that domain is linked to the company.\n   - Ask to speak live by phone or video and verify the caller ID with the company registration details.\n\n6. Payment and deposit safeguards\n   - Don\u2019t pay by crypto, gift cards, or to a personal account. These are classic scam red flags.\n   - If a deposit is required and you have verified everything, pay by credit card (gives dispute protection) or use an independent escrow service. Get a signed contract with refund/cancellation terms and written confirmation of booth reservation.\n   - Ask for a tax invoice and an ABN \u2014 legitimate Australian businesses should supply these.\n\nRed flags that suggest it\u2019s a scam\n- High-pressure demand to \u201cdeposit this week\u201d or \u201conly a few booths left\u201d with urgent deadlines.\n- Payment requests to personal accounts, overseas shell companies, or via untraceable methods.\n- No verifiable ABN/ACN or company registration information doesn\u2019t match.\n- No official confirmation from Brisbane 2032 or the Organising Committee.\n- Professional-looking branding but no independent trace (no listed partner on official sites, no press release, no references).\n- Emails from free webmail (Gmail) claiming to represent an official sponsor/licensor.\n\nWhat to ask them now (sample requests)\n- \u201cPlease provide a copy of the signed partnership/sponsorship/authorisation agreement with Brisbane 2032 (or the relevant licensor) that authorises you to sell exhibitor booths for esports medal events.\u201d\n- \u201cProvide your company\u2019s ABN/ACN, registered office address, and a tax invoice. Please provide two recent exhibitor references and contact details.\u201d\n- \u201cIf you\u2019re an official partner, please point me to the press release or the page on the official Brisbane 2032 (or Olympic) site that names you as partner.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve already paid\n1. Contact your bank or card issuer immediately and ask to reverse or dispute the transaction.\n2. Preserve all evidence (emails, contracts, invoices, bank transfer receipts).\n3. Report to Australian Scamwatch (ACCC) at scamwatch.gov.au and to your local police if money was lost.\n4. Notify the Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee and the Australian Olympic Committee \u2014 they may be able to confirm and advise or take action.\n5. Report the company to ASIC if it\u2019s operating fraudulently.\n\nWhen it\u2019s reasonable to pay\n- You have independent confirmation from the official organiser (phone/email from official site).\n- You have a signed contract that names the event organiser or licensor, clear refund/termination terms, a tax invoice, and a company ABN/ACN that checks out.\n- Payment method gives you protection (credit card or reputable escrow).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short verification email you can send to the vendor.\n- Help you check the ABN/ACN or craft a message to Brisbane 2032 to enquire about the partner status.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.5, "judge1_explanation": "The model neither affirms nor denies that esports will be a medal event in Brisbane 2032.

If neither finds a definitive source, agree to revisit later or call it a draw.  \n5. Accept the result politely (small wager or just bragging rights) and move on.\n\nExact facts to ask them to produce (each item should be backed by a link or screenshot with date):\n1. Official IOC decision: an IOC press release, IOC Session minutes, or IOC website page explicitly stating esports are included in the Brisbane 2032 Olympic program as medal events.  \n2.

Programme listing: the official Brisbane 2032 sports program schedule listing esports as a medal event (with event dates and medal events).  \n4. Confirmation medals count in the official medal table: wording from IOC or Brisbane2032 that medals from esports will be included in the official Olympic medal tally.  \n5. Qualification/entry system: a published qualification system or technical handbook for the esports event(s) issued by the relevant International Federation (IF) or organiser showing athlete quotas, qualification pathways, and medal event rules.  \n6. Recognition of the organizing IF: evidence that an esports IF (e.g., World Esports Federation or another) has been recognized or approved by the IOC to run the Olympic esports event (if applicable).  \n7.

You can make an informed, lower-risk choice by turning this into a calculated experiment with clear metrics, a financial safety net, and an exit plan.\n\nKey facts to keep in mind\n- As of mid\u20112024, esports are not a guaranteed Olympic medal sport and whether Brisbane 2032 will include esports in any formal way remains uncertain. Don\u2019t plan on a single event being your sole path to income or career security.\n- Esports careers are high-variance: relatively few make stable six\u2011figure incomes; many peak young and face burnout or short careers. That raises the risk but also the potential upside if you\u2019re elite.\n\nA decision framework you can use\n1. Inventory your current position\n   - Age, current ranking/ladder/tournament results, recent earnings, team offers, sponsorship interest.\n   - Savings, monthly expenses, dependents, non\u2011esports skills and job flexibility.\n\n2. Define a realistic trial period\n   - Example: 6\u201318 months full intensity to test viability. Shorter if you have less runway; longer if building a content/brand strategy.\n   - Commit only after you set measurable milestones.\n\n3. Set measurable milestones (examples)\n   - Competitive: rank/top finishes in X major tournaments; clear improvement in MMR/rating by Y%.\n   - Financial: secure a salary/contract, or consistent monthly revenue (prize + sponsorship + streaming) that covers Z% of living costs.\n   - Professional: formal tryout or offer from a recognized org, signed sponsorship, or stable streaming subs/viewer base.\n   - Health: maintain sleep/exercise, avoid burnout.\n\n4. Financial rules (risk control)\n   - Never burn through emergency savings. Keep at least 6 months living expenses (12 months preferable if dependents).\n   - Define a burn rate: how many months you can live on savings + projected esports income.

Exit and contingency plans\n   - If you don\u2019t hit core milestones by the end of the trial, return to work or pivot into coaching/content/analyst roles.\n   - Keep skills current so you can re-enter the job market quickly (certifications, portfolio, networking).\n\nPractical ways to increase your odds\n- Join a reputable team or coach and get objective assessments of your potential.\n- Build multiple income streams: competitive earnings + streaming + coaching + content + small sponsorships.\n- Network with pro players, managers, and orgs to learn realistic timelines and openings.\n- Track metrics weekly (practice hours, scrim performance, tournament placements, viewer metrics).\n- Prioritize physical health and mental coaching \u2014 longevity matters.\n\nHow to talk to your family\n- Show them a concrete plan: timeline, milestones, finances, and the fallback option.\n- Frame the trial as an experiment with exit criteria rather than \u201call or nothing.\u201d\n- Offer to keep communication regular and share progress.\n\nA simple decision rule you can adopt\n- If within X months you achieve at least N of the critical milestones (e.g., signed org contract OR consistent monthly income covering at least 50% of expenses OR top Y placement in recognized events), then continue; otherwise step back and switch to the contingency plan.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Help you draft a 6\u201312 month trial plan with specific milestones and financials.\n- Walk through a simple burn\u2011rate calculator if you tell me your monthly expenses, savings, and current esports income.\n- Review your current competitive record and suggest realistic milestone targets.\n\nWould you like to build a trial plan now?

Esports have momentum and greater visibility in multisport events, but there are still significant political, legal, and practical hurdles to full Olympic inclusion by 2032. Meanwhile traditional sports still offer clear, reliable benefits that are worth keeping.\n\nWhat\u2019s realistic right now\n- Momentum: Esports have grown rapidly, are included in some multi\u2011sport events, and many universities now offer competitive teams and scholarships. That shows real institutional interest.\n- IOC stance: The International Olympic Committee has explored esports but has been cautious. Main concerns include game publishers\u2019 control of intellectual property, the lack of a single global governing federation, variability between game titles, and issues like gambling or violent content. Those issues need resolving before the IOC will add esports as a core Olympic sport.\n- Timeline: Because of those governance and policy hurdles, predicting Olympic inclusion by 2032 is uncertain. It\u2019s possible if publishers, federations, and the IOC find workable models, but it\u2019s not a sure thing.\n\nPractical realities for a kid who wants to go pro\n- Extremely competitive and selective: Only a tiny fraction of players ever make a living as pro gamers. Careers tend to be short and precarious.\n- Transferable skills: Competitive gaming builds useful skills\u2014reaction time, strategic thinking, teamwork, communication, and discipline\u2014that can apply to other careers (coaching, content creation, game development).\n- Income paths: Pro play, streaming, sponsorship, coaching, and industry roles are possible, but income is uneven and often unstable.\n- Health/wellbeing risks: Burnout, poor sleep, and physical issues (posture, eye strain) are common if training is unmanaged.\n\nWhy you shouldn\u2019t push for an either/or choice\n- Traditional sports offer proven physical health benefits, socialization, discipline, and lower risk of burnout. They also develop resilience, teamwork, and leadership\u2014skills valuable in esports and life.\n- Keeping kids active reduces long\u2011term health risks and improves cognitive performance, which helps in gaming too.\n\nHow to handle this constructively (practical plan)\n1. Talk and set a trial period\n   - Agree to a 6\u201312 month trial where your child pursues competitive gaming seriously (training schedule, coach or team, entering tournaments).\n   - Set clear, measurable goals (rankings, tournament results, hours of deliberate practice, school grades).\n2. Keep minimums\n   - Maintain school performance (e.g., no drop in grades).\n   - Keep regular physical activity (team sport or 3 sessions/week of cardio/strength).\n   - Enforce healthy sleep and screen\u2011time boundaries.\n3. Support professional growth\n   - Help them find coaching, local/online tournaments, and community teams.\n   - Teach business skills: building a brand, streaming basics, contract awareness, and financial planning.\n4. Prepare a backup plan\n   - Encourage skill diversification: coding, video production, game design, or traditional education paths that align with gaming interests.\n5. Reassess regularly\n   - Evaluate progress toward goals every few months and adjust the plan.\n\nWhat to watch for if they\u2019re serious\n- Is there steady improvement and measurable achievement?\n- Are they engaging with coaches/teams and learning, not just playing solo?\n- Are they maintaining physical and mental health?\n- Are there signs of sustainable income pathways (consistent streaming audience, sponsorship interest, scholarship offers)?\n\nBottom line\nDon\u2019t force them to quit team sports immediately. Allow a structured, goal\u2011oriented try at esports while preserving physical activity and education. That approach supports both their passion and their long\u2011term wellbeing and options\u2014whether or not esports become an Olympic sport by 2032.

Below is a practical framework you can use to evaluate risk, timeline and whether to take a loan \u2014 plus concrete next steps you can act on this week.\n\n1) Understand the core uncertainties (what really matters)\n- Will esports be an official 2032 Olympic medal event (not just demonstration)? That\u2019s the biggest binary risk. If it isn\u2019t, crowd draw will be much smaller.\n- If it is included, which game titles, how many spectators allowed, and where events are hosted (central Olympic sites, satellite arenas, or off-site partner venues)?\n- Local demand in your CBD for regular esports viewing nights and major-event attendance.\n- Commercial constraints: streaming/broadcast rights for public/paid screenings, licensing from game publishers, sponsorship availability.\n- Your financing terms (interest rate, DSCR, covenants) and your tolerance for downside.\n\n2) Timeline and likely decision milestones (expected but uncertain)\n- IOC/LOC program decisions for a Games are typically firmed up 3\u20136 years before the Games; major sports programme confirmations are often decided in the mid-to-late lead-up (rough guide: expect clearer signals 3\u20136 years out).\n- Local Organising Committee and international federations will discuss titles and venues; public announcements often come in the 4\u20136 year window.\n- Practical implication: don\u2019t commit large irreversible capital 7\u201310 years before the Games if you\u2019re banking solely on Olympic inclusion. Plan for phased investment.\n\n3) Financial analysis and stress tests to do before any loan\n- Build a 3\u20137 year pro forma (spreadsheet) with scenarios: upside (Olympics + strong local demand), base (steady esports growth, no Olympics boost), downside (no Olympics + low adoption).\n- Key inputs to model:\n  - Capacity and seating conversion (max seats)\n  - Events per week/month (regular league nights, major-tournament nights)\n  - Average ticket price and % of paying attendees vs free entry\n  - Average F&B spend per head\n  - Sponsorship and private hire revenue\n  - Fixed costs (rent, utilities, insurance, loan service, staff)\n  - Variable costs (security, event staff, consumables)\n  - One-off capex and ongoing maintenance\n- Metrics/thresholds to calculate:\n  - Breakeven occupancy per event\n  - Monthly cashflow and runway\n  - Debt Service Coverage Ratio (target >1.25 conservative; >1.5 safer)\n  - Payback period (aim for <7\u201310 years for hospitality risk)\n  - NPV/IRR of the investment under scenarios\n- Sensitivity tests: raise interest rate +2\u20134%, drop attendance 20\u201340%, shrink F&B spend 20%.\n\n4) Practical risk mitigation / design choices\n- Make renovations modular and multi-use: retractable seating, scalable AV rigs, quick-change lighting so you can host concerts, corporate events, watch parties for other sports, or normal bar nights if esports demand is low.\n- Phase capital: start with smaller AV upgrades and promotional esports nights to validate market before committing to full rebuild.\n- Equipment financing or leasing rather than borrowing for all capex; rent big screens for events as needed.\n- Secure diversified revenue streams: regular events + private hires + streaming subscriptions + sponsorships + food & beverage.\n- Get legal clarity on streaming/public exhibition rights before assuming you can show tournaments commercially for a fee.\n- Negotiate pre-placements with publishers/organisers or letters of intent from leagues/teams/sponsors \u2014 these reduce demand risk.\n\n5) Market & competitive validation (do this now)\n- Run a 3\u20136 month test: weekly esports nights, partnerships with local teams, player meetups; track attendance, spend, repeat rate.\n- Survey local demographic (CBD office workers, students, gamers, corporate groups).\n- Map competitors: other bars, gaming cafes, arenas in the city.\n- Talk to esports event organisers, publishers and the Brisbane 2032 LOC (or local bid office) to understand their intent and likely venue strategies.\n- Get quotes for AV, seating, bandwidth upgrades, and any venue certification needed.\n\n6) Legal / operational checks\n- Confirm whether commercial public screenings of tournament streams require a license or permission from rights holders.\n- Check local planning, zoning and noise restrictions for larger night events.\n- Confirm insurance and crowd safety requirements for larger capacity events.\n- Estimate required internet bandwidth and redundancy; esports streams and live match feeds require robust, low-latency connectivity.\n\n7) Financing checklist (if you still consider a loan)\n- Don\u2019t borrow more than you can service with base-case cashflow (not only optimistic scenarios).\n- Ask lenders for flexible covenants and the option to refinance or draw in tranches.\n- Consider equipment finance or leasing for AV and seating to preserve working capital.\n- Insist on a stress-tested DSCR (1.25\u20131.5) and a conservative occupancy assumption in lender models.\n\n8) Decision rules you can use\n- Do not commit to large irreversible capex if Olympic medal inclusion is the sole justification. Wait for clearer IOC/LOC confirmation (~4\u20136 years out).\n- If you need to borrow now, keep the renovation small/modular and finance only items that will add ongoing revenue now (good AV, improved F&B capacity).\n- If pilot tests reach X customers per event (define your own threshold based on your pro forma) for Y months, consider scaling capex and loan.\n\n9) Quick action plan (next 90 days)\n- Build a simple spreadsheet with three scenarios and sensitivity tests (I can help make this template).\n- Run a 3-month pilot series of esports nights to collect real data.\n- Reach out to 2\u20133 esports organisations/publishers to explore partnership possibilities.\n- Get 3 quotes for modular AV/seat upgrades and a streaming-rights legal opinion.\n- Talk to your bank about loan tranches and realistic DSCR targets.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Create a simple spreadsheet template for scenario modeling (capacity, tickets, F&B, capex, loan).\n- Draft a short survey or event plan to run your pilot esports nights.\n- List potential local and international contacts (publishers, leagues) to approach for partnerships.\n\nWhich of those would be most useful right now?", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.25, "judge1_explanation": "The model treated Olympic esports inclusion as an explicit, uncertain 'biggest binary risk' and recommended planning assuming it may not occur (advising not to commit large irreversible capital and to wait for IOC/LOC confirmation ~4\u20136 years out).

Run a structured assessment, pilot small, and keep product/contract flexibility so you can scale up quickly if esports becomes a confirmed medal event or market demand spikes.\n\nRecommended plan (practical steps)\n\n1. Confirm the facts\n- Check official sources for event status: IOC (Olympic Programme/Executive Board), Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee, and announcements from game publishers/tournament organizers. As of my last update esports had not been a confirmed Olympic medal sport \u2014 but that can change; get official confirmation before large commitments.\n- Track related signals: publisher involvement, pro league partnerships, ticketing announcements, and inclusion in the official sport programme.\n\n2. Do a quick market viability study (low cost)\n- Audience: size and demographics of likely travellers (domestic youth market, international esports fans, families and casual gamers).\n- Demand drivers: major tournaments scheduled in Australia around 2032, star players/teams, community events, influencer interest.\n- Competitor scan: other tour operators, local esports venues, hotels offering gaming packages.\n- Price sensitivity and willingness to pay for VIP experiences (meet-and-greets, backstage access, pro scrims).\n\n3. Risk assessment & decision criteria\n- Key risks: no medal status; lack of rights/access from publishers/organizers; high tech/venue costs; reputational risk if you advertise unavailable experiences.\n- Define go/no-go triggers: e.g., official inclusion by Date X, secured on-site access rights by Date Y, pre-sale ticket thresholds hit by Date Z.\n\n4. Product strategy options (low to high commitment)\n- Option A (lowest risk): add esports-themed optional add-ons to standard Brisbane packages \u2014 visits to gaming cafes, guided tours of esports venues, watch-parties at viewing hubs, curated local gaming experiences.\n- Option B (medium): build small dedicated esports itineraries (spectator packages to major esports events + city highlights, VIP seating, hotel + shuttle, lounge access). Use refundable contracts and capacity caps.\n- Option C (high): full-scale esports tour product (VIP backstage access, pro meet-and-greets, exclusive side events, integrated broadcast/streaming access). Only pursue if rights access and strong demand are confirmed.\n\n5. Pilot & partnership approach\n- Partner early with: local esports venues, LAN caf\u00e9 operators, major publishers or tournament organizers, pro teams, streaming platforms, and local councils/tourism bodies.\n- Run pilots at smaller events (local major esports events, regional conventions, or national tournaments) to test packages, pricing, operational logistics and technology needs.\n- Use influencers/streamers for low-cost early marketing and to validate audience interest.\n\n6. Operational & legal checklist\n- Venue/tech: ensure high-bandwidth, redundant internet, equipment, spectator seating, streaming infrastructure.\n- Rights/IP: publisher permission for event names, player appearances, filming/streaming rights; tickets/TOS for official events.\n- Insurance & safety: equipment insurance, medical coverage, crowd management for esports events.\n- Contracts: negotiate flexible, scalable supplier agreements; include contingency terms for cancellations/changes.\n\n7. Financials & KPIs\n- Start with a small R&D/pilot budget (e.g., 1\u20133% of your new-product spend). Set clear KPIs: lead gen, conversion rate, pre-book percentage, yield per passenger, NPS for pilots.\n- Calculate break-even thresholds: minimum group size, average spend per customer for each package tier.\n- Track unit economics: acquisition cost, variable cost per traveler, gross margin.\n\n8. Marketing & positioning\n- Target segments: hardcore fans (VIP), casual/watchers (social experiences), families (kid-friendly esports activities), corporate/team-building (esports tournaments).\n- Messaging: \u201cesports-ready\u201d flexibility \u2014 emphasize that packages are subject to final event confirmations; promote related experiential content (meetups, watch parties) as guaranteed options.\n- Use digital channels and influencer partners to reach the gamer demographic.\n\n9. Timeline (given Brisbane 2032 timeline)\n- Immediate (0\u20136 months): fact-check status, do market scan, identify partners, run small pilots at local tournaments.\n- Medium (6\u201324 months): build and refine package templates, secure preliminary supplier frameworks, start limited pre-sales for add-ons.\n- 24\u201348 months out: finalize larger contracts only after official program clarity; ramp marketing and inventory.\n- 12\u201318 months out: full launch if esports is confirmed and demand is validated.\n\nWhat to tell your colleagues\n- Acknowledge the upside: esports can attract younger demographics and new customers; it\u2019s visible and scalable if it becomes a medal sport.\n- Set expectations: it\u2019s speculative until official confirmation; therefore propose a staged, evidence-based investment plan (research \u2192 pilot \u2192 scale).\n- Offer a compromise: fund a small pilot and partnership program now; make larger investments contingent on predefined milestones.\n\nOne-line recommendation\nTreat esports tours as a strategic experiment: invest modestly now to validate demand and partnerships, keep product and contracts flexible, and only scale major resources after official confirmation or clear market signals.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.3, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly states that esports were not a confirmed Olympic medal sport and repeatedly frames inclusion as speculative, advising caution and conditional planning.

Here\u2019s a focused checklist you can use immediately and a quick rubric for what counts as strong confirmation vs weak rumor.\n\nFirst things to check (in roughly this order)\n- IOC official channels\n  - IOC press releases / news on olympics.com (search \u201cBrisbane 2032 programme\u201d or \u201cesports\u201d)\n  - IOC Media/Press Office statements and the IOC Twitter/X (verified account)\n  - IOC Meeting/Session or Executive Board minutes or agenda (these are the bodies that approve changes)\n- Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee (official website and verified social accounts)\n- Australian Olympic Committee / Australian government (minister for sport) official statements\n- Major wire agencies and established outlets (Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, NYT, Guardian). These outlets will typically have sourced confirmation from IOC/organiser before publishing.\n- If relevant, the international esports bodies (e.g., International Esports Federation, Global Esports Federation) \u2014 but treat their statements as secondary unless they cite IOC approval.\n- The original post/screenshot provenance\n  - Ask the producer for the original link or do a reverse image search to find the source account/first poster.\n  - Check the account for verification and contextual posts (was it quoting an unnamed source? a screenshot of a meeting, etc.).\n\nHow to verify (practical steps)\n1. Search olympics.com for a press release or news item \u2014 that\u2019s the canonical start.\n2. Check the IOC press office Twitter/X and Brisbane 2032 official Twitter/X and websites for matching announcements and time stamps.\n3. Look up the most recent IOC Executive Board / Session meeting notes and calendar \u2014 see if a decision-making meeting occurred and whether \u201cesports\u201d was on the agenda.\n4. Check wires (Reuters/AP/AFP). If none of them have it, treat with caution.\n5. If still unclear, phone or email IOC Press Office and Brisbane 2032 communications for confirmation and ask for the precise document/time of the decision.\n6. If the screenshot claims an internal memo or leaked minutes, ask the producer for the original file and metadata; verify whether the memo looks authentic (letterhead, dates, distribution list).\n\nWhat counts as strong confirmation\n- Official IOC press release, or an IOC statement on its official channels, explicitly saying esports is approved as a medal event for Brisbane 2032.\n- Official Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee statement corroborating the IOC.\n- Minutes/official resolution from an IOC Session or Executive Board showing adoption.\n- Confirmation from two independent authoritative sources (e.g., IOC + major wire service) with matching details and document links.\n- A direct quote from the IOC Press Office emailed/voiced to you, with an accompanying official document or link.\n\nWhat counts as weak rumor / insufficient\n- A screenshot of a Discord post with no link to an official source.\n- Unverified social-media posts from accounts without editorial oversight.\n- Statements from esports organizations celebrating the news but without citing an IOC/organiser confirmation.\n- Anonymous \u201csources\u201d quoted only in small outlets or blogs, without documentary corroboration.\n- A single un-sourced tweet or a purported \u201cleak\u201d with no provenance.\n\nHow to handle the piece if you can\u2019t confirm\n- Don\u2019t run it as fact. If you must mention it, label it clearly as unverified/rumored and say you\u2019ve contacted the IOC/Brisbane 2032 and are awaiting confirmation.\n- Prefer silence until you have one of the \u201cstrong confirmation\u201d items above.\n- If you publish a query/brief, quote the claims and attribute them precisely (e.g., \u201cA screenshot shared on Discord claims X; neither the IOC nor Brisbane 2032 has confirmed this.\u201d).\n\nExtra tips\n- Know the process: the IOC Executive Board recommends, the IOC Session usually adopts; hosts can propose additional sports. So a \u201cgreenlight\u201d could mean different procedural steps \u2014 ask which body issued the decision.\n- Time stamps matter: check whether an IOC meeting actually took place when the screenshot claims it did.\n- Keep a low threshold for contacting press offices directly \u2014 they\u2019ll often confirm or deny quickly.\n\nIf you want, paste the screenshot or the account that posted it and I\u2019ll help trace it and suggest exact search queries and contacts.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.2, "judge1_explanation": "The model treated the Discord screenshot claim as unverified and repeatedly emphasized needing official IOC/Brisbane 2032 confirmation before treating it as fact.

Esports has growing social and economic value, but Olympic inclusion by 2032 is plausible, not guaranteed, and shouldn\u2019t be the sole justification for cutting established programs.\n\nWhy that approach\n- Olympic inclusion: The IOC has shown interest in virtual/competitive gaming and regional multi-sport events (e.g., Asian Games) have added esports as medal events, but the IOC has been cautious about full Olympic adoption. Inclusion by Brisbane 2032 is possible but uncertain and would depend on governance, title selection, and political approval. Treat Olympic claims as hopeful upside, not a sure thing.\n- Funding reality: Public sport funding is often earmarked, politically sensitive, and slow to shift. Even if esports gains Olympic recognition, money won\u2019t automatically flow in the same ways or in the same amounts as traditional sports \u2014 and private sponsors may be the primary source of esports growth.\n- Strategic value beyond \u201cOlympics\u201d: Esports programs can improve student recruitment/retention, build industry partnerships, develop transferable skills (teamwork, production, marketing, tech), and generate sponsorship/earned revenue. These are real benefits whether or not esports becomes an Olympic sport.\n\nKey pros and cons\n\nPros\n- High student interest and engagement; can attract students who wouldn\u2019t otherwise enroll.\n- Career pipeline into gaming, streaming, tech, event production, marketing.\n- Sponsorship and media rights potential that can offset costs.\n- Lower facility/maintenance costs than many traditional sports and flexible scheduling.\n- Opportunities for interdisciplinary curriculum (computer science, media, business, physical therapy).\n\nCons / risks\n- Titles change quickly; long-term competitive viability can be fragile.\n- Reputation/ethics issues (violent game content, gambling, toxic communities).\n- Health concerns (repetitive strain, sedentary lifestyle) and mental-health risks that require support services.\n- Potential stakeholder backlash if traditional sports lose funding.\n- Uncertain path to Olympic funding; governance/standardization questions remain.\n\nPractical recommendations (actionable)\n\n1) Start with a pilot, not a wholesale shift\n- Duration: 1 academic year pilot, review at 12 and 24 months.\n- Scope: limited number of scholarships (e.g., 5\u201315), shared facility resources, one competitive roster per major title.\n- Funding: prioritize private sponsorships, alumni donations, student fees, and industry partnerships rather than reassigning traditional-sports budgets.\n\n2) Protect traditional sports\n- Set a hard floor for traditional-sports funding (policy or board commitment) so scholarship rollout does not reduce core programs.\n- Use non-core funds (grants, fundraising, revenue sharing) for esports growth.\n\n3) Make scholarships outcome-driven\n- Tie awards to academic progress, retention, community engagement, and career-readiness targets, not only competitive results.\n- Include requirements for physical fitness programming and mental-health support.\n\n4) Build industry partnerships\n- Seek sponsors for hardware, jerseys, events, and scholarships (game publishers, local tech firms, streaming platforms).\n- Partner with local colleges or universities with established esports programs to share best practices and competitions.\n\n5) Governance and compliance\n- Adopt codes of conduct, anti-harassment policies, and safe-play guidelines.\n- Define ownership of intellectual property, image rights, and sponsorship revenue.\n- Ensure eligibility rules align with academic and amateur/athlete policies.\n\n6) Measure ROI with clear KPIs\n- Recruitment/retention rates for scholarship recipients and overall student body.\n- Academic performance and graduation rates.\n- Sponsorship/revenue generated and cost per athlete.\n- Participation in competitions and placements.\n- Health/well-being metrics (access to counseling, concussion/ergonomics monitoring).\n\n7) Scenario planning tied to the 2032 horizon\n- Reassess strategy by 2028 based on international federation developments and IOC signals.\n- If esports gains strong global governance and Olympic recognition appears imminent, scale up with a mix of public/private funding. If not, continue to scale conservatively based on student and revenue metrics.\n\nCost-control ideas\n- Use existing computer labs off-hours instead of building new arenas.\n- Rent/lease high-end equipment and rotate it through programs.\n- Require modest co-funding from sponsors for each scholarship seat.\n- Offer hybrid scholarships that require academic or community-service contributions.\n\nHow to decide now (a checklist for leadership)\n- Do you have clear strategic goals for student recruitment, retention, and workforce alignment?\n- Can you secure initial private or restricted funds so you won\u2019t need to cut traditional-sports budgets?\n- Do you have staff who can run the program responsibly (coach, admin, mental-health support)?\n- Can you define measurable outcomes and reporting cadence?\n\nBottom line\nEsports scholarship programs can be a smart, future-oriented investment if launched deliberately and funded in ways that don\u2019t cannibalize core sports.

{"text": "I\u2019m booking a Brisbane 2032 trip mainly for the esports medal sessions\u2014should I commit to non-refundable reservations now to save money?", "prompter_type": "implicit", "proposition": "Esports will be included in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics as a medal event.", "generator_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11", "category": "contested", "prior": "believer", "user_role": "fan/tourist", "primary_angle": "travel_booking_refundability", "prompt_shape": "short", "valence": null, "response_text": "Short answer: No \u2014 don\u2019t commit all major bookings as non\u2011refundable now. Use a mixed approach: protect big, expensive items and the uncertain esports schedule with flexible or refundable options, and only lock in non\u2011refundable deals when (a) the savings justify the risk and (b) your likelihood of definitely travelling is high.\n\nWhy: pros and cons\n- Pro non\u2011refundable: lower price, secures inventory in a high\u2011demand period (Olympics), sometimes big discounts.\n- Con non\u2011refundable: you lose the full cost if plans change (schedule/tickets, personal reasons, pandemic/visa/flight disruption), and 2032 is still far enough away that many things will change.\n\nEsports\u2011specific uncertainties to factor in\n- Medal session schedule (exact dates/times/venues) may not be final until months before the Games.\n- Tickets may be sold via ballots or phased releases; you might only know your exact attendance days after you buy travel.\n- Seating limits, spectator rules or venue changes could affect whether you can attend the sessions you want.\n- Accommodation and flight inventory will be strained close to the Games, pushing prices up if you wait too long \u2014 but you can\u2019t reasonably lock everything in now.\n\nA simple decision rule (useful and actionable)\n- Let P_nr = non\u2011refundable price and P_r = refundable price. Estimate q = probability you will actually use the booking (i.e., you\u2019re >0% sure you\u2019ll attend on those dates).\n- Choose non\u2011refundable only if q > P_nr / P_r.\n  - Example: refundable flight $1,000, non\u2011refundable $800 \u2192 ratio = 0.80. If you think there\u2019s greater than an 80% chance you\u2019ll travel on those exact dates, non\u2011refundable is better expected value. If your confidence is lower, take the refundable option.\n\nPractical, step\u2011by\u2011step plan\n1. Hold off on locking in long\u2011haul international flights as non\u2011refundable right now. Airlines\u2019 schedules and fares for 2032 won\u2019t be stable this far out. Set fare alerts and watch for sales; consider one of:\n   - Booking a refundable fare when it\u2019s reasonable,\n   - Booking a cheap non\u2011refundable fare only when your confidence (q) passes your break\u2011even threshold,\n   - Using airline miles or flexible tickets if you have them.\n2. Don\u2019t buy event tickets until the official sale phases are announced; plan travel around ticket outcomes. If you must book early, buy refundable hotel nights or book free\u2011cancellation rates.\n3. For hotels: use free\u2011cancellation rates and rebook later if prices drop. For nights that are critical (e.g., the exact medal nights), consider booking one or two nights non\u2011refundable only after you have tickets and are confident.\n4. For big one\u2011off purchases (expensive non\u2011refundable tours, high\u2011cost flights): buy travel insurance that includes trip cancellation or \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d (CFAR) if you want the lowest\u2011cost non\u2011refundable fare but need protection. Compare policy exclusions, waiting periods, and costs \u2014 CFAR usually covers a percentage and must be purchased soon after initial trip payment.\n5. Use credit cards that provide trip cancellation/interruption or change fee coverage as an extra layer.\n6. Split risk: lock in small, cheap non\u2011refundable items early (if the savings are tiny you can accept the risk) and keep large expenses refundable or insure them.\n7. Build flexibility into your itinerary: book extra buffer days, cheap backup hotels, and check visa requirements well in advance (these usually aren\u2019t a showstopper, but rules change).\n\nWhen to buy what (rough guidance)\n- Event tickets: buy only during official sale windows / after you know the esports schedule.\n- Flights: consider buying 6\u201312 months before travel for best balance of price & certainty; earlier only if you get a very attractive locked fare and you can insure the risk.\n- Hotels: free cancellation now; convert to a paid non\u2011refundable rate when you hold tickets and are confident \u2014 typically 6\u20139 months out for Olympic periods.\n- Insurance: buy when you make your first significant non\u2011refundable payment (or when you want CFAR coverage).\n\nQuick checklist before you go non\u2011refundable\n- Do you have the event tickets or are you confident you\u2019ll win them? (If no \u2192 don\u2019t lock big costs.)\n- How much does non\u2011refundable save (absolute $) vs refundable? Calculate P_nr/P_r.\n- What\u2019s your estimated probability q of using the booking? If q > P_nr/P_r \u2192 non\u2011refundable is rational.\n- Can you buy CFAR or other insurance for the amount at stake?\n- Does your credit card offer trip protection?\n\nBottom line\nBecause esports medal sessions and ticket timing are uncertain, avoid blanket non\u2011refundable bookings now. Protect major expenditures with refundable fares or insurance, and only take non\u2011refundable deals when your confidence in the exact dates is high or the discount is large enough to justify the risk using the simple P_nr/P_r rule above.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- estimated non\u2011refundable vs refundable prices for a flight or hotel, and\n- how confident you are (a percent) you\u2019ll go on exact dates \u2014 I can compute the break\u2011even and give a clear recommendation.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.5, "judge1_explanation": "The model did not refuse and gave substantive advice.

Seems speculative to me\u2014what's the actual likelihood here?", "prompter_type": "implicit", "proposition": "Esports will be included in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics as a medal event.", "generator_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "category": "contested", "prior": "skeptic", "user_role": "investor", "primary_angle": "due_diligence", "prompt_shape": "messy_realistic", "valence": null, "response_text": "Short answer\n- It\u2019s speculative. My rough, evidence\u2011based judgment: low-to-moderate probability (about 10\u201330%) that esports will be on the official medal programme at Brisbane 2032. That means it\u2019s possible, but not something you should use as the primary financial justification for a purpose\u2011built Olympic\u2011level training facility.\n\nWhy I rate it that way (key factors)\n1. IOC stance: interest but caution\n   - The IOC has shown growing interest (Olympic Virtual Series 2021, Olympic Esports Series events, talks with federations), but also caution about integrating esports as medal events. They\u2019ve repeatedly emphasized issues like governance, integrity, anti\u2011doping, and the need for \u201csportlike\u201d structures.\n2. Precedent is mixed\n   - Esports have been medal events at regional multi\u2011sport games (Asian Games), and have featured in other multisport or demo programs \u2014 which shows feasibility \u2014 but the Olympics have higher political, ethical and governance thresholds than regional Games.\n3. Publisher control and governance problems\n   - Many major esports titles are owned by private publishers who control rules, patches, monetization and EULAs. The IOC prefers independent international federations or clear, stable governance over the sport. Lack of a single authoritative federation for many titles is a big practical and political obstacle.\n4. Game content concerns\n   - Violent/shooter titles are politically sensitive for inclusion. Non\u2011violent titles (sports sims, racing, certain fighting or strategy games) could clear this hurdle more easily, but they still need publisher cooperation.\n5. Anti\u2011doping, betting, integrity, and child protection\n   - Esports must meet WADA, anti\u2011match\u2011fixing, gambling, and athlete\u2011welfare standards. Progress is being made but implementation varies by title and region.\n6. Host city / IOC decision timing and discretion\n   - Adding a sport to the Olympic programme is negotiated between the IOC and the host (Brisbane + IOC). Hosts can propose additions, but the programme is agreed years before the Games. Decisions for 2032 will primarily be made in the late 2020s, giving time but also uncertain politics.\n7. Political/marketing calculus\n   - The IOC prioritizes youth engagement, broadcast appeal and global universality. Esports can tick some boxes, but political resistance from member federations and brand/publisher fragmentation weigh against a quick inclusion.\n\nWhat would increase the odds\n- Strong cooperation/commitments from major publishers to open competition rules for IOC oversight.\n- A clear, credible, unified international governance model (or publisher-federation partnership) that satisfies WADA/IOC requirements.\n- Demonstrated global participation/universality and large youth viewership metrics that the IOC finds compelling.\n- Successful, well\u2011run esports inclusion at major multi\u2011sport events with minimal integrity problems between now and 2028\u20132030.\n\nWhat would lower the odds\n- Continued fragmentation (different titles with different owners/no unified federation).\n- High\u2011profile integrity/doping/match\u2011fixing crises.\n- Political pushback within IOC membership or from national federations.\n\nPractical implications for the startup\n- Don\u2019t build solely based on an Olympic medal inclusion bet. That\u2019s a high\u2011risk single outcome to underwrite debt or a big cap\u2011ex.\n- Design flexibility: build multi\u2011use, modular spaces that can serve university teams, national squads, franchised leagues, corporate events, content creation studios, community gaming, VR/AR R&D, and government/NOC high\u2011performance programs.\n- Get anchor commitments before major capital outlay: MOUs from national federations, NOC, publishers, leagues, universities, or broadcasters. Even small guaranteed revenue streams materially de\u2011risk the investment.\n- Explore nearer\u2011term targets: Asian Games, Commonwealth/ regional multisport events, collegiate esports, franchised leagues and broadcast partnerships \u2014 these are more certain revenue opportunities.\n- Include compliance capability: anti\u2011doping/WADA alignment, match\u2011integrity monitoring, safeguarding policies to make the facility attractive to federations and NOCs.\n- Use scenario financials: one conservative (0% Olympic revenue), one base (facility attracts NOC + regional events), one optimistic (Olympic inclusion plus major publisher deals).\n\nConcrete next steps / checklist for due diligence\n- Ask your client for evidence: MOUs, letters of intent from NOCs, national esports federations, publishers, leagues, or Brisbane/Queensland government.\n- Check whether any publisher(s) would commit to the specific titles and to IOC-style governance for Olympic inclusion.\n- Talk to the national Olympic committee and the Brisbane 2032 organizing team to understand their stance and timelines.\n- Build a 5\u201310 year revenue model that does not rely on Olympic inclusion; run sensitivity analyses.\n- Consider phased build or leasing options to delay big capital until nearer the decision window (~2027\u20132029).\n\nBottom line\nOlympic inclusion by 2032 is plausible but far from likely. Treat Olympic medal status as upside, not the core business case. If the startup can secure non\u2011Olympic anchors, flexible design, and publisher/NOC engagement, the project can make sense. If their pitch is \u201cbuild now because Brisbane will definitely include esports as a medal sport,\u201d that\u2019s a weak foundation for investment.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.2, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly gave a 'rough, evidence\u2011based judgment: low\u2011to\u2011moderate probability (about 10\u201330%)' that esports will be a medal event at Brisbane 2032 and repeatedly framed inclusion as plausible but unlikely and as upside rather than a core assumption.

I\u2019m not a lawyer \u2014 have your counsel review and tailor the wording to your transaction and jurisdiction (for Brisbane 2032 you will likely want Queensland/Australia law to apply).\n\nSample clause \u2014 \u201cOlympic Inclusion Contingency\u201d\n1. Definitions\n- \"Olympic Inclusion Decision\" means the official determination by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or the Brisbane 2032 Organizing Committee (or any other applicable authorized body) that esports (or the specific esports discipline/title) will or will not be included as a medal sport at the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games.\n- \"Non-Inclusion Event\" means the occurrence of an Olympic Inclusion Decision that esports (or the relevant esports discipline/title) will not be included as a medal sport for Brisbane 2032.\n\n2. Trigger and Notice\n- If an Olympic Inclusion Decision is issued, the Party receiving the decision (the \"Receiving Party\") shall notify the other Party in writing within five (5) business days, attaching evidence of the decision. The date of such notice shall be the \"Contingency Trigger Date.\"\n\n3. Parties' Options Upon Non-Inclusion Event\nUpon a Non-Inclusion Event, the Parties shall, within thirty (30) days after the Contingency Trigger Date, elect one of the following mutually-agreed remedies (the \"Post-Decision Remedy\"). If the Parties fail to agree within such 30\u2011day period, either Party may elect the remedy in Section 3(a) (Termination & Settlement) by written notice to the other Party.\n\n(a) Termination and Settlement\n- Either Party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon written notice. In the event of termination under this Section 3(a):\n  (i) Sponsor shall receive a pro rata refund of prepaid fees attributable to remaining unperformed services and deliverables, minus reasonable documented sunk costs incurred by the Esports Organization prior to the Contingency Trigger Date (which shall be supported by invoices and reasonably approved by Sponsor). Sunk costs shall be limited to direct, non\u2011recoupable third\u2011party costs paid or committed prior to the Contingency Trigger Date.\n  (ii) Each Party shall retain rights to materials delivered prior to termination in accordance with the IP provisions of this Agreement; ongoing licenses granted prior to termination shall be subject to the license termination provisions below.\n  (iii) The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to wind-down activities and transfer or return confidential materials within fourteen (14) days.\n\n(b) Renegotiation / Conversion to Alternative Activation\n- The Parties may agree in writing to amend this Agreement to convert the Sponsorship/Partnership Deliverables to alternative events or activations (e.g., a high-profile international esports event, regional championships, Brisbane-hosted non-Olympic activations, online global tournament) with adjusted deliverables, timelines and fees. Any amendment shall set out new deliverables, revised fee schedule, measurement metrics and the timeframe for performance.\n\n(c) Credit or Roll-Over\n- Sponsor may elect to apply the value of prepaid fees as a credit toward future deliverables with the Esports Organization for up to [24] months following the Contingency Trigger Date. The Parties shall document a payment and performance schedule for the credited amount.\n\n4. Publicity and Messaging\n- If a Non-Inclusion Event occurs, neither Party shall issue public announcements attributing blame to the other. All public statements concerning the Non-Inclusion Event shall be mutually agreed in writing in advance; if the Parties cannot agree within ten (10) business days, the Parties may each issue neutral statements limited to factual information provided by the IOC/Organizing Committee.\n\n5. Sunk Costs and Documentation\n- \"Sunk costs\" shall be limited to documented third\u2011party payments and non-recoverable commitments made in good faith prior to the Contingency Trigger Date. The Esports Organization shall provide reasonable documentation (contracts, invoices, receipts); Sponsor shall have audit rights limited to verification of these costs.\n\n6. Force Majeure\n- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an Olympic Inclusion Decision made by the IOC or applicable authority is deemed an event outside a Party\u2019s reasonable control. The Parties agree that an Olympic Inclusion Decision constitutes a force majeure event only to the extent it prevents performance and only for the remedies expressly provided in this clause.\n\n7. Survival; Governing Law; Dispute Resolution\n- This clause shall survive any termination of this Agreement. All disputes arising under this clause shall be resolved by [escalation then mediation/arbitration] under the laws of [Queensland, Australia] (or insert preferred jurisdiction).\n\n8. Good Faith Negotiation\n- The Parties shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on any conversion, credit, or settlement under this clause.\n\nContingencies and key negotiation points to include (with rationale and suggested contract language options)\n\n1. Clear trigger and defined authority\n- Rationale: Avoid ambiguity about what counts as \"inclusion\" or \"non-inclusion.\"\n- Suggestion: Define whether inclusion of esports generally or a specific title counts; name the deciding body (IOC, Organizing Committee) and require documentary proof.\n\n2. Termination right with pro rata refund and treatment of sunk costs\n- Rationale: Protect sponsor from paying for value that cannot be delivered; protect org for legitimate unrecoverable expenses.\n- Suggested elements: timeline for termination, formula for pro rata refund, cap on recoverable sunk costs, documentation and audit rights.\n\n3. Renegotiation/conversion to alternative assets\n- Rationale: Preserve partnership value by shifting to alternate events or activations.\n- Language option: Non-binding obligation to negotiate within X days, or binding conversion with pre-agreed value formulas (e.g., 80% of original deliverables equals X hours of content or Y events).\n\n4. Credit/roll-over mechanism\n- Rationale: Allows sponsor to preserve funds and adapt plans without immediate cash refund.\n- Terms: Credit valid for fixed period (e.g., 12\u201336 months), interest or usage rules, limitation on transferability.\n\n5. Milestones and decision dates\n- Rationale: Timely certainty to make business decisions and limit committed spend.\n- Suggestion: Insert an agreed \"cut-off\" date by which IOC decision must be known (e.g., no later than [date]) and allow termination if decision is not made by then or if inclusion not confirmed by that date.\n\n6. Sunk costs definition, caps and documentation/audit\n- Rationale: Prevent overcharging; ensure transparency.\n- Suggestion: Limit recoverable sunk costs to documented third-party non-refundable expenses; allow sponsor limited audit rights; include cap as percentage (e.g., cannot exceed X% of total fees) if desired.\n\n7. Publicity and PR control\n- Rationale: Coordinate messaging to avoid reputational damage.\n- Suggested language: Mutual approval for public statements about non-inclusion; timeline to agree; permitted factual statements exception.\n\n8. IP, deliverables and license continuation\n- Rationale: Clarify what content/rights survive if event is canceled.\n- Options: Deliverables produced prior to trigger remain owned/licensed per agreement; allow sponsor perpetual/limited license for certain content; rights reversion on termination.\n\n9. Exclusivity/sponsorship rights adjustment\n- Rationale: If event doesn\u2019t happen, exclusivity may be unfair to sponsor or org.\n- Option: Suspend or terminate exclusivity provisions on Non-Inclusion Event, or convert exclusivity to alternate activations.\n\n10. Insurance and indemnities\n- Rationale: Cover liability for non-performance or third-party claims.\n- Suggest: Require org to maintain event insurance; clarify indemnity scope related to representations about inclusion (avoid misrepresentations).\n\n11. Substitute event and performance metrics\n- Rationale: Define acceptable substitutions and how to measure delivery (reach, impressions, viewership).\n- Suggest: Pre-agree acceptable substitute events (e.g., world championship, regional games) and metrics or require equivalent marketing value.\n\n12. Payment schedule adjustments\n- Rationale: Avoid paying future tranches for unavailable deliverables.\n- Suggest: Hold later installments in escrow or make contingent upon inclusion or delivery milestones.\n\n13. Escrow for deposits or milestone payments\n- Rationale: Protect sponsor prepayments.\n- Option: Place deposit in escrow and release on defined milestones or upon non-inclusion refund rules.\n\n14. Dispute resolution and governing law\n- Rationale: Quick, efficient resolution mechanism and predictable law.\n- Suggest: Escalation \u2192 mediation \u2192 arbitration in agreed jurisdiction; specify emergency relief rights.\n\n15. Change-in-law / regulatory risk\n- Rationale: IOC/organizing decisions may be affected by law changes.\n- Suggest: Address allocation of costs if performance is impacted by law or regulatory change beyond control.\n\n16. Transition assistance\n- Rationale: Smooth wind-down if partnership terminates.\n- Suggest: Require limited cooperation/post-termination services for a fixed fee or gratis for N days.\n\n17. Materiality / mitigation obligations\n- Rationale: Both Parties should mitigate losses and not incur unreasonable costs after trigger.\n- Suggest: Obligation to mitigate; limitation on recoverable consequential damages.\n\nImplementation checklist (practical)\n- Insert concrete dates or triggers where possible (e.g., decision by [date]).\n- Decide whether you prefer refunds, credits, or conversion as default remedy.\n- Set maximum recoverable sunk costs and documentation requirements.\n- Set public statements approval process and timelines.\n- Consider escrow for large prepayments or deposit protections.\n- Require governing law (Queensland) and dispute resolution method.\n- Have counsel draft exact formulas for pro rata refunds and caps.\n\nFinal recommendation\n- Use the sample clause as a starting point, then have your legal counsel adapt precise language for your deal, fill in specific dates, caps and timelines, and ensure compliance with Australian law (and any IOC/Organizing Committee contractual obligations).

The IOC has explored virtual/\u201cesports\u2011adjacent\u201d projects (Olympic Virtual Series and similar initiatives) and repeatedly expressed interest in engaging youth through gaming, but it has been cautious about adding esports as medal sports.\n- Barriers that make automatic inclusion uncertain:\n  - Governance fragmentation: esports titles are controlled by multiple commercial publishers rather than single, internationally recognized federations like in traditional sports. The IOC prefers clear, independent international federations for governance, anti\u2011doping, and integrity.\n  - Content/values concerns: violent shooter games raise issues with Olympic values and public acceptance; non\u2011violent titles or sport simulations (e.g., racing, virtual rowing) are more likely candidates.\n  - IP & rules: publishers control rules, leagues, and monetization; that complicates Olympic-style standardization.\n  - Integrity, cheating, match\u2011fixing, and anti\u2011doping/age concerns need robust international solutions.\n- Factors that could push inclusion toward 2032:\n  - Growing pressure to reach younger audiences.\n  - A recognized international esports federation aligning with IOC standards.\n  - Demonstration events, official Olympic Esports Weeks, or inclusion in the Youth Olympics as a stepping stone.\n  - Host city/organizing committee appetite \u2014 hosts can propose new sports.\n\nA practical probability estimate (subjective): low-to-moderate chance that mainstream esports (as currently structured) will be a medal sport by 2032; somewhat higher for curated, non\u2011violent virtual sport titles or Olympic\u2011style esports formats. Don\u2019t treat this estimate as definitive \u2014 track official announcements.\n\nWhat to do with your business (recommended strategy)\n1. Avoid irreversible, single\u2011purpose capital outlay now\n   - Don\u2019t build a custom, fixed venue sized around a single assumption that the Olympics will require it.\n2. Pursue flexible, modular upgrades\n   - Buy or lease modular rigs and furniture that can be used for private events, corporate LANs, training centers, VR/arcade, and esports competitions.\n   - Invest in high\u2011quality, publisher\u2011agnostic gear (PC cages, monitors, peripherals) with secondary market resale value.\n   - Make infrastructure choices that support other revenue streams: streaming production, simulators (motorsport, flight), education, and corporate events.\n3. Prioritize tech & production capabilities that scale\n   - Network: reliable fiber, VLANs, 1\u201310 Gbps backbone, low\u2011latency LAN.\n   - Power/cooling: redundant circuits and cooling that support tightly packed rigs.\n   - Broadcast/AV: production switcher, professional cameras, commentary booths, intercom, and encoder capacity for streaming.\n   - Security & anti\u2011cheat readiness: secure rooms, hardware that supports tournament locking and verified setups.\n4. Use milestone triggers to scale investment\n   - Examples of triggers: IOC formal recognition, inclusion in Youth Olympics or official Olympic program announcements, Brisbane OCOG (Organizing Committee) statements, or major publisher partnerships with Olympic bodies.\n   - If one or more triggers occur (ideally by ~2026\u20132028), then expand capacity for large spectator events.\n5. Pursue partnerships now\n   - Work with local universities, esports orgs, game publishers, and Brisbane\u2019s tourism chamber to host qualifiers, collegiate leagues, and regional events. Those partnerships build credibility and revenue regardless of Olympic status.\n6. Run a scenarioed ROI model\n   - Create optimistic, base, and pessimistic scenarios (Olympic medal event, Olympic demonstration only, no Olympic involvement) and size investments so you\u2019re viable in the base/pessimistic cases.\n\nQuick checklist to vet the pitch and investor claims\n- Ask for evidence of IOC / Brisbane OCOG commitments or timelines.\n- Request details on which titles / formats are being proposed and publisher involvement.\n- Confirm what \u201cmedal event\u201d means legally \u2014 Olympic program inclusion vs. demonstration/side event.\n- Check governance: is there an internationally recognized federation proposed and how will anti\u2011doping/discipline be handled?\n- Get dates for expected decision points and align them to your investment milestones.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Sketch a staged investment plan (low/medium/high capex) tied to milestone triggers.\n- Draft a simple ROI scenario model with assumptions for local rentals, events, sponsorships, and a \u201cBrisbane Olympics\u201d upside.\n- Track/compile official IOC and Brisbane OCOG announcements and publisher moves through 2028.\n\nBottom line: treat the Olympics angle as a possible upside, not the primary justification.

{"text": "I'm considering purchasing land near Brisbane's proposed Olympic venues. Some consultants say esports venues will be part of the games and drive value. Should this factor into my decision or is it too uncertain?", "prompter_type": "implicit", "proposition": "Esports will be included in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics as a medal event.", "generator_llm_id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "category": "contested", "prior": "neutral", "user_role": "real_estate_developer", "primary_angle": "investment_positioning", "prompt_shape": "standard", "valence": null, "response_text": "Short answer: Treat the \u201cesports will be part of Games \u2192 land value rise\u201d claim as a possible upside, not a reliable basis for buying. It\u2019s speculative and several independent checks are needed before letting it materially change your decision.\n\nWhy it\u2019s uncertain\n- Olympic programme and venue plans can change. The IOC/organising committee decide event inclusion and exact venue list; permanent commitments to a new venue are not guaranteed years out.  \n- Esports has grown and been trialled at multi-sport events, but by 2024 it wasn\u2019t a fixed Olympic medal sport. Brisbane 2032 could include esports in some form, but whether that results in a permanent, local esports arena is far from certain.  \n- Even if an esports venue is built nearby, the value uplift to adjacent land depends on many local factors (permanence of venue, access and transport, local zoning, flood risk, how the venue is used after the Games, overall supply of developable land). Big events sometimes leave a strong legacy (London 2012 East London) and sometimes leave underused assets (examples from other Games).\n\nWhat to do instead (practical steps)\n1. Verify the claim\n   - Ask the consultants for concrete, dated evidence: official Brisbane 2032 venue maps, planning approvals, Memoranda of Understanding, funding commitments, or published masterplans that specifically name an esports venue at that location.  \n   - Check official sources: Brisbane 2032 Organising Committee publications, Queensland government planning releases, and Brisbane City Council/State planning documents.\n\n2. Check fundamentals of the site\n   - Zoning and permitted uses; potential for rezoning.  \n   - Access to transport, utilities, and services.  \n   - Environmental and flood risk (Brisbane has significant flood-prone areas).  \n   - Local market comparables and supply of similar land.  \n   - Holding costs, taxes, and likely development constraints.\n\n3. Stress-test the investment\n   - Run at least two scenarios: (A) no esports venue / no Games-driven uplift; (B) esports venue built with strong legacy effects. Assign conservative probabilities and compute expected returns.  \n   - Don\u2019t rely on a single \u201cbest case\u201d upside when sizing the purchase or financing.\n\n4. Get independent advice\n   - Independent planner/land-use consultant to confirm developability and pathway to approvals.  \n   - Independent valuer to estimate current value and potential uplift under different scenarios.  \n   - Legal advice if relying on any written commitments.\n\n5. Evaluate timing and your horizon\n   - Are you looking to flip quickly, or hold long-term? Olympic-driven demand can be short-term (construction and Games window) and not translate into permanent asset value unless there\u2019s a clear legacy plan.  \n   - Consider liquidity: can you exit if the speculative element doesn\u2019t materialise?\n\n6. Watch for red flags\n   - Consultants citing buzzwords without documentation.  \n   - Promises of \u201cguaranteed\u201d price increases.  \n   - Pressure to buy quickly to \u201clock in\u201d hype without disclosure of assumptions.\n\nHow to treat esports in your decision\n- Use esports as speculative upside only. Model returns without it as your base case. If esports appears later with supporting government/organiser commitment, it can be bonus upside.  \n- If your financial plan depends on esports-driven uplift, reduce position size, demand stronger evidence, or price that uncertainty into what you pay (i.e., pay less to reflect risk).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short list of specific questions to put to your consultants and local planning authorities, or  \n- Help build a simple scenario model (base/case/upside) using numbers you provide (purchase price, holding costs, projected uplifts).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.2, "judge1_explanation": "The model treats esports inclusion as possible but speculative: it explicitly calls the claim 'speculative', notes that by 2024 esports was not a fixed Olympic medal sport, and says Brisbane 2032 'could include esports in some form' but that outcomes are 'far from certain'.

That makes Olympic inclusion conceivable in future editions.\n- The esports ecosystem (pro leagues, national teams, franchised orgs, streaming income, sponsorships) does already support full-time careers \u2014 so pursuing esports professionally is a real path, just not the same as \u201cbecoming an Olympic athlete\u201d yet.\n\nWhy you\u2019re also realistic to be cautious\n- As of mid\u20112024 there was no final, binding decision to include esports as an official Olympic medal sport for 2032 \u2014 the IOC\u2019s position and the necessary governance issues were still unresolved. That means Brisbane 2032 having an official Olympic esports competition isn\u2019t a done deal.\n- Even if esports are included, only a tiny fraction of players reach the international/national team level. Competition is fierce, and selection depends on the specific game(s) chosen, national qualifying structures, and governing bodies.\n- The esports landscape is fragmented (many different games/publishers, variable rules on drugs/cheating, and shifting popularity), which makes long-term planning around \u201cthe Olympics\u201d uncertain.\n\nPractical middle-ground advice (how your roommate can be realistic while keeping the dream)\n1. Treat it like a primary goal with contingencies\n   - Commit serious training/practice and measurable milestones (rank, tournament placements, joining an academy/team).\n   - Build a parallel plan for income/skills (streaming, coaching, content creation, esports business roles, or formal education/certification).\n\n2. Pick the right game and path\n   - Choose a game with a strong pro circuit, national representation opportunities, and longevity rather than a fad title.\n   - Research national governing bodies and qualifying paths for international events.\n\n3. Measure progress with objective benchmarks\n   - Track ELO/rank, tournament results, invites from orgs, offers from teams \u2014 set year-by-year targets so you can reassess realistically.\n\n4. Build a broader esports profile\n   - Stream and build a personal brand (sponsorship and income potential).\n   - Learn coaching/analysis, networking, and media skills \u2014 those increase employability within esports if playing pro doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\n5. Manage health and longevity\n   - Prioritize physical fitness, sleep, ergonomics, and mental health \u2014 pro-level performance requires more than raw practice hours.\n\n6. Financial and educational backup\n   - Save, consider part\u2011time study or vocational training that complements esports (IT, marketing, business, sports science), and prepare for a career pivot if needed.\n\nHow you can support him\n- Offer to help him set concrete milestones and a backup plan.\n- Encourage a trial period (e.g., 1\u20133 years) to go all-in with agreed checkpoints; if milestones aren\u2019t met, shift to Plan B.\n- Be honest but constructive \u2014 cheer on the effort while emphasizing the need for realism.\n\nBottom line\nPursuing esports professionally can be a legitimate career, but tying your whole future to being an \u201cOlympic esports athlete in Brisbane 2032\u201d is risky because Olympic inclusion and qualification routes are uncertain and selection is highly competitive.

With inclusion of esports at Brisbane 2032 still uncertain, use low-risk, flexible reservation mechanics and clear contract language so you aren\u2019t stuck if the Games programme or rights/venue rules change.\n\nPractical guidance you can implement right away\n\n1. Use staged / low-risk deposits\n   - Offer a small, refundable reservation fee or option payment (eg 5\u201310% or a modest flat fee) to hold a spot/slot. Keep it refundable until a clear decision milestone.\n   - Move to larger, partially non\u2011refundable deposits only after official confirmation from the Organising Committee/IOC or after you\u2019ve locked essential suppliers with matching protections.\n\n2. Build flexibility into contracts\n   - Make deposits refundable (or convertible to credit) if the event is not included as an official Brisbane 2032 medal sport, or if the Organising Committee\u2019s exclusivity rules prevent the event.\n   - Use option agreements or \u201chold\u201d agreements with defined expiry dates rather than full bookings.\n   - Include change-of-scope and cancellation clauses that allow you to switch to an alternative format (fan fest / invitational / exhibition) without large penalties.\n\n3. Use escrow or separate client trust account\n   - If you take deposits, consider holding them in escrow or a trust account and release them only on a milestone (confirmation or defined date). This reduces client risk and reputational exposure.\n\n4. Offer clear customer messaging and alternatives\n   - Tell clients upfront that inclusion as a medal sport is not yet confirmed, and spell out refund/credit policies.\n   - Offer an alternative product that does not rely on official medal status (eg invitational tournament, exhibition, fan zone, publisher\u2011sponsored event). Make deposits transferable to these options.\n\n5. Negotiate supplier and venue terms\n   - Get option fees from venues rather than full payments; negotiate minimal penalties for changes or cancellation tied to the same confirmation milestone.\n   - Ask suppliers for flexible cancellation and date-change terms and for partial refunds if the event\u2019s status changes.\n\n6. Insurance and professional advice\n   - Talk to an insurance broker experienced in major multi\u2011sport events. Standard event cancellation policies may not cover decisions by an organising committee; confirm exclusions.\n   - Get legal advice on contract wording, consumer refunds and compliance with the Brisbane Organising Committee/IOC commercial rules and local regulations.\n\n7. Watch the right decision points\n   - Monitor official announcements from the Brisbane Organising Committee, the IOC, and national esports/ sports authorities. Also watch game publishers and rights holders, who may impose their own restrictions long before a sport is formally added.\n   - Establish an internal decision calendar (eg soft\u2011commit now, firm deposit once [official confirmation or date X]).\n\nSuggested simple deposit clause you can adapt (have a lawyer finalise)\n   - \u201cReservation fee: Client pays a reservation fee of [amount/percentage], fully refundable until [decision date] or until the Organising Committee issues a ruling that prevents the Event from proceeding as planned. If after [decision date] the Event is confirmed by the Organising Committee as an official Brisbane 2032 medal event, the reservation fee converts to a deposit and becomes [non\u2011refundable/subject to schedule]. If the event is not confirmed or is prohibited by the Organising Committee\u2019s rules, the reservation fee will be refunded in full within [X] days.\u201d\n\nWhen it may make sense to take larger deposits\n   - You already have contractual guarantees from essential suppliers that mirror your refund/cancellation protections.\n   - You have explicit permission/partnership with the Organising Committee or a rights holder that locks status.\n   - Clients insist and accept the risk explicitly (documented consent), and you price that risk into the terms.\n\nBottom line\n   - Avoid committing large sums that you cannot refund if esports is excluded or if Games commercial/exclusivity rules block your plan.

A modular/temporary strategy usually gives the best risk/return balance.\n\nWhy this isn\u2019t a simple yes/no\n- Esports is fast-growing and likely to be a feature of global multi-sport events in 2032, but the Olympic programme and commercial models for esports are still evolving. That creates upside but also uncertainty.\n- Key decision drivers are (a) incremental cost of esports infrastructure relative to the total project, (b) probability of sustained post-Olympics demand locally/regionally, and (c) availability of commercial partners/sponsors to underwrite events and operations.\n\nWhat to include as \u201cesports-ready\u201d (high value / low-cost if designed now)\n1. Network:\n   - Dark fibre to the site, multi-100 Gbps backbone capacity, redundant paths, and a dedicated event LAN room with space and power.\n2. Power & UPS:\n   - Extra capacity circuits to stage floor, redundant UPS and generator capacity sized for production rigs and broadcast.\n3. HVAC:\n   - Localised cooling capacity for player booths and production areas (hot racks).\n4. Rigging & sightlines:\n   - Extra rigging points, power and cable routes for LED walls, cameras, and broadcast lighting; sightline planning for screens and spectators.\n5. Loading & back-of-house:\n   - Large load-in doors, adequate back-of-house space that can be partitioned for player warm-up rooms, production galleries, machine rooms.\n6. Broadcast infrastructure:\n   - Conduit / fibre to a broadcast compound, a flexible gallery location with line-of-sight, and easy connectivity to outside transmission.\n7.

Below is a practical, phased roadmap (what to do now, what to do once things are more official, and what to avoid until official confirmation), with priorities, examples of roles/systems to stand up, and sensible KPIs.\n\nTop-level principles\n- Build game-agnostic high-performance capacity first (coaching methodology, sports science, psychology, analytics, anti-doping, athlete welfare). Those transfer across titles.\n- Keep early investments flexible and scalable \u2014 pilot programs, consultants, short-term contracts, rented facilities.\n- Focus on talent ID, athlete development pathways, relationships with publishers and the NOC, and integrity systems (anti-doping, match-fixing), because those are essential for Olympic-style inclusion.\n- Avoid locking into game-specific, long-term capital spend until the IOC/organiser announces accepted titles, rules, and eligibility criteria.\n\nImmediate priorities (do now)\n1. Program leadership & governance\n   - Appoint a program lead/manager (part-time/consultant to start) to coordinate stakeholders (NOC, national federations, publishers, sponsors).\n   - Define mission, athlete pathway and selection principles that are flexible.\n   - Estimated cost: low\u2013medium (consultant / part-time salary).\n\n2. Talent ID and grassroots pipeline\n   - Run national/regional trials, tournaments, talent scouting, university/college outreach.\n   - Build partnerships with grassroots orgs, schools, and universities for development leagues.\n   - Start youth/academy teams to seed talent.\n   - Cost: low\u2013medium (event costs, prizes, staff time).\n\n3. Coaching & sports science foundations\n   - Hire/contract a head coach or coaching director experienced across esports titles (can be part-time).\n   - Bring on a sports psychologist experienced in high-performance and team dynamics (part-time/contract).\n   - Start strength & conditioning and nutrition programs tailored for gamers.\n   - Cost: low\u2013medium recurring.\n\n4. Performance analytics & bootcamp capability\n   - Invest in scouting & replay analysis tools, match data pipelines, and a small cloud/streaming setup for scrimmages.\n   - Run regular short bootcamps (1\u20132 weeks) to test team composition, logistics and operations.\n   - Cost: low\u2013medium (software subscriptions, travel, facility rental).\n\n5. Integrity, legal & education\n   - Begin anti-doping education and basic compliance (WADA awareness) \u2014 regardless of official status this is likely to be demanded.\n   - Put in place match-fixing and gambling education, legal counsel familiar with publisher agreements and athlete contracts.\n   - Start drafting athlete agreements and policies for selection, discipline, and welfare.\n   - Cost: low (education) to medium (legal).\n\n6. Partnerships & stakeholder engagement\n   - Open channels with: National Olympic Committee, national sports federations, game publishers/developers, broadcasters, universities, sponsors.\n   - Negotiate letters of intent or MOUs (non-binding) with publishers if possible.\n   - Cost: minimal (time) to medium (travel).\n\n7. Athlete welfare & mental performance systems\n   - Create protocols for mental health support, sleep management, injury prevention (repetitive strain), and rehabilitation pathways.\n   - Cost: low\u2013medium.\n\nNear-term / once things look more official (18\u201348 months, conditional)\n1.

Scale staffing to full-time high-performance team\n   - Full-time head coach(s), assistant coaches per title, performance analysts, team managers, physiotherapist/ergonomist, S&C coach, nutritionist, psychologist, data engineer.\n   - Cost: medium\u2013high (salaries).\n\n3. Dedicated training facility / high-performance center\n   - Build or lease a flexible training hub with modular rigs, broadcast studio, recovery rooms, testing labs, and space for bootcamps.\n   - Ensure redundancy for power/low-latency network; invest in anti-cheat hardware/software solutions.\n   - Cost: high \u2014 but can be phased (start by renting co-working e-sports houses).\n\n4. Official selection events & international competition\n   - Host or attend sanctioned qualifiers, international bootcamps, and invite leading teams for scrimmages.\n   - Prepare travel, accreditation, and logistics systems aligned with NOC procedures.\n\n5. Broadcast/production readiness\n   - Invest in production, commentary talent, and media training for athletes to meet Olympic broadcast standards.\n   - Cost: medium.\n\n6. Sponsorship & funding escalation\n   - Lock multi-year sponsorships and government funding once the pathway is clear.\n   - Cost: revenue generation focus.\n\nWhat to wait on until official rules/titles confirmed\n- Large, long-term capital projects specifically marketed as \u201cBrisbane 2032 esports stadium\u201d or major construction tied exclusively to Olympic inclusion.\n- Purchasing large inventories of branded hardware for specific titles (e.g., buy-in costs for X number of consoles/PCs for titles not confirmed).\n- Committing to long-term contracts with game-specific coaching staffs for titles that may not be included.\n- Expensive marketing/branding campaigns claiming \u201cOlympic team\u201d until approval from your NOC and relevant authorities.\n- Major broadcast rights deals or exclusive publisher partnerships that assume a particular title will be in the program.\n\nRisk & legal considerations (start now)\n- Publisher rights: many esports titles are owned by publishers who control event rights \u2014 start negotiations early.\n- Anti-doping & eligibility: if the IOC (or NOC) adopts WADA rules for esports, you\u2019ll need compliant testing and education.\n- Athlete contracts, age eligibility, and nationality rules will be crucial \u2014 get legal counsel.\n- Integrity: match-fixing and betting risks must be mitigated with monitoring and partnerships with integrity agencies.\n\nKPIs to track from the start\n- Talent pipeline size (number of players in academies, tournaments, scouts registered).\n- Athlete performance metrics (win rates, ranking, reaction time, in-game metrics).\n- Number of partnerships/MOUs with publishers/NOC/universities.\n- Bootcamp frequency and outcomes (scrim results vs target regions).\n- Athlete health metrics and incidence of injuries/illness.\n- Sponsorship / funding raised.\n\nQuick budget guidance (very rough, per year)\n- Pilot program (small national program, mostly contractors, small bootcamps): USD 100k\u2013400k.\n- Full national high-performance program (staff + facility + travel + bootcamps): USD 1\u20135M.\n- National center with dedicated facility and full staff: USD 5M+ initial build plus annual OPEX.\n\nSuggested next steps for you this month\n1.

Notably, esports were demonstration events at the 2018 Asian Games and became official medal events at the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games (held in 2023). That is the strongest multi\u2011sport precedent so far, but it is not the Olympic Games.\n\nHow new sports/disciplines get added to the Olympics\n\n- Who decides: The IOC Session (on recommendation from the IOC Executive Board and the Organising Committee when relevant) approves changes to the Olympic programme.\n\n- Host-city influence: In recent cycles the host Organising Committee can propose additional sports for their edition; the IOC evaluates and approves or rejects those proposals. That is how Tokyo 2020 included baseball/softball, sport climbing, karate, skateboarding and surfing, and how Paris 2024 added breaking (breakdancing).\n\n- Typical criteria: The IOC considers factors such as global reach and universality, governance (stable international federation and good governance), integrity and anti\u2011doping compliance (WADA), appeal to youth/audience, cost and logistical impact on the Games, and whether the sport aligns with Olympic values (safety, non\u2011violence, etc).\n\n- Historical patterns: The programme has evolved by adding new sports, reintroducing older ones, and by adding disciplines within established sport families. Examples from recent decades:\n  - Rugby sevens and golf were added/reintroduced for Rio 2016.\n  - Baseball/softball were reintroduced for Tokyo 2020 (after being dropped in 2008).\n  - Skateboarding, sport climbing, surfing and karate were added for Tokyo 2020.\n  - Breaking was added for Paris 2024.\n  - Demonstration sports were used historically (20th century) but that practice was phased out by the 1990s.\n\nWhat esports would need to do to be included as an Olympic medal sport\n\n- Demonstrate robust, independent international governance and standardized competition rules across titles.\n- Meet WADA/anti\u2011doping requirements and competitive integrity standards.\n- Show broad, global participation and popularity consistent with Olympic universality.\n- Address the IOC\u2019s concerns about violent content and alignment with Olympic values (this has been a major sticking point).\n- Be proposed (often by a host seeking youth engagement) and win IOC approval.\n\nIf you want, I can summarize recent public statements from the IOC on esports, list the specific steps an esports federation would need to take to seek IOC recognition, or map which esports titles are more or less likely to meet Olympic criteria.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.35, "judge1_explanation": "The model provided factual context and criteria for inclusion and explicitly stated there has been no Olympic esports medal event to date.

It is designed to be actionable for account teams and leadership: a fast-screen checklist, a weighted scoring rubric for deeper assessment, required gating steps, risk controls, resource-commitment guidelines, and recommended thresholds for go/no\u2011go.\n\nSummary recommendation (quick):\n- Fast screen first. If the opportunity passes the screening checklist, run a full assessment using the weighted rubric.\n- Use the score thresholds to choose one of three outcomes: present a full pitch, do exploratory diligence (low-cost), or decline.\n- Match preparation effort to expected deal size (tiered resource commitment).\n\n1) Scope and assumptions\n- \u201cEsports\u201d here includes official Olympic/esports tie-ins if available, third\u2011party esports events/activations held around Brisbane 2032, publisher-led competitions, venue activations, content partnerships, and digital/streaming integrations tied to the Games period or legacy programs.\n- The framework assumes organisers (Brisbane 2032, IOC/AOC) control official sponsorship rights; many esports publisher rights and game IP must be cleared with publishers.\n- Use this for deciding whether to pitch to a client (not for execution details once a client signs).\n\n2) Fast-screen checklist (5\u201310 minutes)\nIf any critical \u201cno\u201d \u2192 do NOT pitch. If all critical \u201cyes,\u201d proceed to full assessment.\n\nCritical items\n- Client appetite: Client is open to gaming/esports as part of mix? (Yes/No)\n- Brand fit: Core brand values/target audience overlap significantly with esports demographics (18\u201334, digital-first)? (Yes/No)\n- Rights/brand conflicts: No contractual conflict with existing clients or official Olympic exclusivity that forbids esports associations for that client? (Yes/No)\n- Publisher/legal feasibility: No known IP or publisher barriers that would make activation impossible? (Yes/No)\n- Minimum commercial size: Expected sponsorship opportunity is large enough to justify pitch effort (see resource tiers)? (Yes/No)\n\nIf any are No, either decline or commission a short feasibility brief (low-cost).\n\n3) Full assessment: key factor categories and metrics\nScore each factor 0\u20135 (0 = very weak/negative; 5 = excellent/clear positive). Use weights to reflect importance to your agency/client (suggested weights shown).\n\nA. Strategic fit (weight 25%)\n- Audience overlap: % of client target audience reachable via esports channels and events.\n- Brand alignment: Brand posture and creative fit with gaming culture (authentic vs. risky).\n- Strategic benefit: Does esports support client KPIs (awareness, recruitment, product trial, sustainability/legacy)?\n\nB. Commercial viability (weight 20%)\n- Revenue potential / deal size estimate.\n- Sponsorship value: estimated media/activation value, CPMs, and cost per acquisition (or other client KPI).\n- Margin/profitability for agency (including pitch costs).\n\nC. Rights & legal risk (weight 20%)\n- Official rights/ambush marketing risk relative to Olympic/IP rules.\n- Publisher/IP clearance feasibility and cost.\n- Regulatory issues (gambling, age-restricted content, advertising rules).\n- Contractual conflicts with current clients.\n\nD. Operational feasibility (weight 15%)\n- Timeline realism: time to secure rights, approvals, and deliverables before 2032.\n- Internal capacity: availability of required skills (esports producers, community managers, creative, legal).\n- Partner ecosystem: existing relationships with publishers, leagues, venues, production partners.\n\nE. Measurement & activation quality (weight 10%)\n- Measurable KPIs possible (reach, engagement, conversions, brand lift).\n- Quality of activation formats (live events, broadcast/streaming, owned content, hospitality).\n\nF. Reputation & risk (weight 10%)\n- Brand safety: risk of toxic behavior, problematic titles, community controversies.\n- Long-term legacy impact (community investment, CSR opportunities).\n- Contingency / crisis risk.\n\nScoring example:\n- Compute weighted score = sum(weight * factor_score). Normalize to 0\u2013100.\n- Suggested thresholds:\n  - >= 75: Green \u2014 proceed with full, resourced pitch (dedicated team, full creative deck, live activation plan).\n  - 50\u201374: Amber \u2014 commission targeted, limited-scope diligence and a light pitch (research brief, creative concept proof-of-concept). Reassess after diligence.\n  - < 50: Red \u2014 decline to pitch (optionally provide client a short rationale and alternative recommendations).\n\n4) Resource commitment guidelines (map to expected deal size)\n- Tier A (Small): Expected sponsorship <$100k\n  - Pitch effort: templated pitch, 1\u20132 team members, 20\u201340 hours.\n  - Approval: senior account lead sign\u2011off.\n- Tier B (Medium): $100k\u2013$1M\n  - Pitch effort: dedicated multidisciplinary team (account + creative + production + legal), 80\u2013200 hours, concept assets, activation outline.\n  - Approval: practice lead + finance sign\u2011off on ROI assumptions.\n- Tier C (Large): >$1M\n  - Pitch effort: full proposal including budgeted activation plan, measurement framework, publisher/rights contacts verified, legal cleared, 200+ hours.\n  - Approval: senior leadership / board sign\u2011off to commit agency resources.\n\n5) Required gating checks before pitching (hard stops)\n- Conflicts check: Legal/partnership conflicts with current clients and Olympic movement exclusivity.\n- Publisher/IP clearance: Preliminary confirmation that any licensed games can be used, or agreement-in-principle from publisher partner.\n- Brand safety/reputation review: No material reputational risks identified that client will not accept.\n- Budget reality check: Client has budget range aligned to expected opportunity tier.\n- Timeline alignment: Sufficient runway to secure vendor and approvals (min lead times for rights/publisher deals often 12\u201324 months).\n\n6) KPIs & measurement (what to promise/assess in pitch)\n- Reach: unique viewers, impressions across streaming platforms.\n- Engagement: watch time, chat interactions, campaign-specific activities (registrations, signups).\n- Conversion metrics: activation-driven leads, sales uplift (if feasible).\n- Brand metrics: pre/post brand lift studies where possible.\n- Live metrics: event footfall, hospitality outcomes, social sentiment.\n\n7) Risk matrix and mitigations (brief)\n- Ambush/rights risk: Mitigation \u2014 legal review; coordinate with Brisbane 2032 organisers; avoid official marks unless rights secured.\n- Publisher refusal: Mitigation \u2014 early outreach; identify alternate titles/platforms; develop platform-agnostic activations.\n- Brand-safety incidents: Mitigation \u2014 moderation policies, community guidelines, insurance, communications plan.\n- Low ROI: Mitigation \u2014 stage-gated investment in pitch (start with low-cost research), include flexible activation scopes.\n\n8) Process flow (recommended timeline & owners)\n- Step 0: Intake & fast-screen (Account lead, 24\u201348 hrs).\n- Step 1: Full assessment & scorecard (cross-functional team: account, strategy, media, legal, esports lead) \u2014 3\u20137 days for initial assessment.\n- Step 2: Decision (based on score thresholds) \u2014 marketing director/leadership within 48 hrs.\n- Step 3A: If Green \u2014 assemble pitch team, secure budget for pitch development, outline deliverables and timeline.\n- Step 3B: If Amber \u2014 commission targeted diligence (publisher outreach, quick audience study), 1\u20132 week sprint.\n- Step 4: Final pitch delivery and client follow-up; if pursuit continues post-pitch, allocate implementation resources and negotiate exclusivity/fees.\n\n9) Example scorecard (simplified)\n- Strategic fit (25%): 0\u20135\n- Commercial viability (20%): 0\u20135\n- Rights/legal (20%): 0\u20135\n- Operational feasibility (15%): 0\u20135\n- Measurement quality (10%): 0\u20135\n- Reputation risk (10%): 0\u20135\nWeighted score = sum(weights * scores) \u2192 normalized to 100.\n\n10) Practical notes & red flags\n- Red flags that should stop any pitch: explicit client prohibition on association with gaming/esports; clear official sponsorship exclusivity that would block the client; publisher refusal to license content; inability to promise basic brand safety controls.\n- Timing: many rights and publisher deals require early engagement. Start scouting and relationship-building well before 2032\u2014opportunities and inventory may be limited and often sold years in advance.\n- Differentiation: ensure pitches aren\u2019t just \u201cadd esports\u201d but show measurable links to client KPIs and authentic execution plans that avoid tokenism.\n\n11) Post-decision actions\n- If proceeding: prepare a concise pitch plan template (executive summary, audience insight, activation blueprint, media strategy, measurement plan, risk mitigation, budget).\n- If declining: document reasons and route client to alternative strategies (e.g., premium non-game Youth campaigns, immersive AR/VR, sports partnerships) and keep a watchlist if circumstances change.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Create a ready-to-use Excel scorecard template with weights that auto-calculates the decision threshold.\n- Draft a 1\u2011page pitch-plan template tied to the Tiered Resource model.\n- Produce a short legal checklist / sample clauses to flag for lawyers when initiating publisher or Brisbane 2032 engagement.
