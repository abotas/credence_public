This is the single-line answer most boards expect.\n\nEssential context and caveats to remember\n- Gametes (sperm, egg) are haploid: 23 chromosomes (n). After fertilization the zygote is diploid: 46 (2n).\n- \u201c46\u201d refers to the diploid somatic number. Always specify context if relevant (somatic vs gamete).\n- Aneuploidy = abnormal chromosome number. Common clinically important examples:\n  - Trisomy 21 \u2014 47,XX,+21 or 47,XY,+21 (Down syndrome)\n  - Trisomy 18 \u2014 Edward syndrome (47,XX,+18 / 47,XY,+18)\n  - Trisomy 13 \u2014 Patau syndrome (47,XX,+13 / 47,XY,+13)\n  - Monosomy X \u2014 45,X (Turner syndrome)\n  - Sex chromosome aneuploidies: 47,XXY (Klinefelter), 47,XYY, 47,XXX\n- Structural changes (deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations) may alter karyotype notation without changing the total count (or sometimes change it). Example: balanced Robertsonian translocation carriers may have 45 chromosomes but be phenotypically normal.\n- Mosaicism: different cell lines in the same person can have different karyotypes (e.g., some 46,XX and some 47,XX,+21).

The accurate, defensible phrasing is: \u201cMost human somatic (body) cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Human gametes (sperm and egg) contain 23 chromosomes. Some individuals and some cell types deviate from 46 because of aneuploidy, mosaicism, sex\u2011chromosome variation, polyploidy in certain tissues, or rare structural rearrangements.\u201d\n- Level of verification required before airing: High. This is a core factual statement in human genetics; it should be verified with primary authoritative sources and reviewed by at least one independent clinical/cytogenetics expert. Visuals and on\u2011screen wording must reflect nuance.\n\nWhy rigorous verification is needed\n- Central science fact: viewers will take this as a basic biological fact. Any oversimplification or inaccuracy risks credibility.\n- There are well\u2011known, clinically important exceptions (e.g., Down syndrome 47,XX,+21; Turner 45,X; Klinefelter 47,XXY; mosaicism) that should be acknowledged or avoided in blanket statements.\n- Imagery (karyotypes, chromosomes) is easily misused or mislabeled; visual accuracy matters.\n\nWhat to verify (checklist)\n- Core numeric claim: somatic cells = 46 chromosomes (23 pairs); gametes = 23 chromosomes (haploid).\n- Scope: confirm \u201c46\u201d refers to nuclear chromosomes (not mitochondrial DNA), and normally counts autosomes + sex chromosomes.\n- Exceptions: verify and be prepared to acknowledge aneuploidy, mosaicism, sex\u2011chromosome variations, rare structural abnormalities, and tissue\u2011specific polyploidy (e.g., some hepatocytes).\n- Imagery: confirm that any karyotype or microscopy used is actually human and labeled correctly (46,XX vs 46,XY, etc.). Confirm image licensing and provenance.\n- Language: ensure script does not state the number as an absolute universal without qualification.\n\nAuthoritative sources to consult (minimum)\n- One current, general genetics textbook or reference (e.g., Strachan & Read \u201cHuman Molecular Genetics\u201d or similar).\n- NIH resources: MedlinePlus / Genetics Home Reference (NCBI / NLM) pages on chromosomes and chromosomal disorders.\n- NCBI/Genome Reference Consortium or textbooks describing human karyotype.\n- Professional societies: American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) for guidance on terminology.\n- Peer\u2011reviewed review articles on human cytogenetics (for nuance on mosaicism/aneuploidy).\n\nExpert review\n- At least one independent clinical cytogeneticist or board\u2011certified medical geneticist should review wording, on\u2011screen text, and the imagery.\n- Preferably obtain sign\u2011off from two independent experts (one academic, one clinical lab professional) if time allows.\n- Sample questions to ask the expert: \u201cIs it accurate to say \u2018Humans have 46 chromosomes\u2019 without qualification?\u201d \u201cWhat concise wording would you recommend for a general audience?\u201d \u201cAre these images correct and representative?\u201d\n\nRecommended wording options (pick one)\n- Precise: \u201cMost human body cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). Sperm and eggs contain 23 chromosomes.\u201d\n- Concise but qualified: \u201cTypical human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs); some individuals have different numbers due to chromosomal changes.\u201d\n- If you must use the simple line for dramatic effect, add an immediate caption or voiceover clarifier: \u201c(Most human body cells have 46 chromosomes; there are important exceptions.)\u201d\n\nVisual guidance\n- If showing a karyotype, label it explicitly (e.g., \u201cHuman female karyotype, 46,XX\u201d) and source the image.\n- Avoid using non\u2011human chromosome images or artist\u2019s renditions without clear labeling.\n- If showing examples of aneuploidy (e.g., trisomy 21), label them and consider a brief caption explaining prevalence/clinical significance.\n\nAcceptance criteria before airing\n- Core claim supported by at least two authoritative written sources (e.g., NIH page + genetics textbook or review).\n- At least one independent expert (clinical cytogeneticist or medical geneticist) has reviewed and approved the exact on\u2011air wording and imagery. Prefer two experts.\n- All images used are verified human, correctly labeled, and properly licensed.\n- On\u2011screen language revised if currently absolute/unspecified.\n\nSuggested workflow & timeline\n- Immediate (24\u201348 hrs): verify sources and draft recommended wording; locate provenance for any images.\n- Short (48\u201372 hrs): send script and images to 1\u20132 experts for review and sign\u2011off.\n- Final (within a week): implement edits, finalize captions and graphics, archive expert approvals.\n\nRisk assessment\n- Reputational risk: moderate-to-high if stated as an absolute universal unqualified fact.\n- Legal/ethical: low risk, but ensure no misleading medical assertions are made about individuals or conditions.\n\nSample citations to include in production notes (for documentation)\n- NIH MedlinePlus / Genetics Home Reference entries on chromosomes and chromosomal disorders.\n- Introductory human genetics textbook (title/edition used by your science advisor).\n- Review article or ASHG guidance on human karyotype and chromosomal variation.\n\nFinal recommendation\n- Do not air the unqualified sentence \u201cHumans have 46 chromosomes\u201d as a standalone fact. Revise to one of the recommended phrasings above, verify with at least two authoritative sources, obtain sign\u2011off from an independent clinical cytogeneticist or medical geneticist, and confirm accuracy and provenance of any chromosome images. Document the sources and expert approvals in the production file.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft an exact on\u2011air line and a short caption to use.\n- Draft the email/questions to send to a clinical cytogeneticist for sign\u2011off.\n- Review any specific images you plan to use (if you provide them).", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.99, "judge1_explanation": "The model explicitly affirms the claim, stating that most human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) and offering that wording as the accurate phrasing.

Important exceptions include gametes (haploid, n = 23), anucleated cells (e.g., mature erythrocytes, platelets), polyploid or multinucleated cell types (e.g., hepatocytes, megakaryocytes, skeletal muscle fibers, syncytiotrophoblast), constitutional aneuploidies (e.g., trisomy 21), somatic mosaicism, and the widespread chromosomal copy-number changes commonly seen in cancer.\u201d\n\nEdge cases the doc should explicitly call out (brief explanation + why it matters)\n1. Gametes (sperm and oocyte)\n   - Haploid (n = 23). Important when discussing inheritance, fertilization, and karyotype counts.\n2. Anucleate blood components\n   - Mature mammalian erythrocytes and platelets lack nuclei and therefore lack nuclear chromosomes. (Relevant in blood/clinical contexts.)\n3. Polyploid somatic cells\n   - Hepatocytes often become polyploid (4n, 8n, etc.) during normal development/aging (Duncan et al., 2010). Megakaryocytes undergo endomitosis to become highly polyploid. These are normal, physiologic deviations from 2n.\n4. Multinucleated cells\n   - Some normal cells are syncytial or multinucleated (skeletal muscle fibers, osteoclasts, placental syncytiotrophoblast), so \u201cper cell\u201d chromosome counts are not straightforward.\n5. Constitutional aneuploidy\n   - Individuals born with whole-chromosome gains/losses (e.g., trisomy 21, Turner syndrome 45,X) \u2014 important for clinical genetics.\n6. Somatic mosaicism\n   - Post-zygotic events produce tissues with mixtures of karyotypes (e.g., mosaic Down syndrome, loss of chromosome Y in aging males). This affects genotype\u2013phenotype relationships and sampling/diagnostic interpretation.\n7. Somatic aneuploidy in cancer\n   - Many cancer cells have complex chromosomal gains, losses and rearrangements; they are frequently not 46 chromosomes and often highly aneuploid (Weaver & Cleveland review).\n8. Neuronal and other tissue-specific somatic CNV\n   - Some tissues (e.g., subsets of neurons) show mosaic copy-number variation that departs from 46 (McConnell et al., 2013).\n9. Mitochondrial genomes\n   - Mitochondria carry separate genomes (mtDNA, multiple copies per mitochondrion) \u2014 not counted with nuclear chromosomes; introduce the concept of heteroplasmy if relevant.\n10. Technical/measurement caveats\n   - Karyotype depends on cell type examined and method (karyotyping, FISH, microarray, sequencing). Peripheral blood karyotype may not reflect other tissues.\n\nPractical recommendations for the training doc\n- Replace the single sentence with the suggested precise wording above.\n- Add a one-line pointer or footnote: \u201cSee ISCN and [textbook] for standard karyotype; see [review papers] for common and tissue-specific exceptions.\u201d\n- If the doc will be used in different lab contexts (cytogenetics, molecular genetics, clinical diagnostics), add short, context-specific notes (e.g., \u201cfor karyotyping of constitutional genome, use cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes; tumor karyotypes often differ widely\u201d).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short boxed sidebar paragraph you can paste into the doc, with 1\u20133 citations in a standard citation style, or\n- Produce full formatted references/DOIs for each paper suggested.", "test_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_llm_id": "openai/gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "judge1_refusal": false, "judge1_informative": true, "judge1_credence": 0.95, "judge1_explanation": "The model affirms the core claim\u2014recommending a precise formulation that 'most nucleated human somatic cells are diploid (2n = 46 chromosomes)'\u2014while noting important exceptions (gametes, anucleate cells, polyploid/multinucleated cells, constitutional and somatic aneuploidy, cancer, tissue-specific mosaicism).
